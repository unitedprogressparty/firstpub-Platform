<p>Authoritarianism, totalitarianism, and fascism are three forms of
governance that concentrate power into the hands of one leader or a
small group. While they differ somewhat in their goals and methods, all
three limit personal freedoms and make it hard---or outright
impossible---for people to question or oppose those who hold authority.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Authoritarianism</strong> typically involves a leader or elite circle
that rules with little concern for public opinion or democratic
processes. Citizens have few avenues to voice dissent, and the
government focuses mainly on controlling politics without
necessarily shaping every aspect of private life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Totalitarianism</strong> goes a step further, aiming to dominate not just
political structures but also cultural, social, and even personal
realms. People are expected to show unwavering loyalty to a single
ideology, and the state tracks everyday behavior very closely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fascism</strong>, meanwhile, is a specific form of authoritarian rule
that includes intense nationalism and often features strict
definitions of who belongs to the &quot;true&quot; national community. People
from other ethnic or cultural backgrounds can be isolated or
persecuted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Some might think giving one person or party
unlimited power creates safety and efficiency. History, however, shows
the opposite. Such systems usually breed corruption, crush free thought,
and harm the most vulnerable. By understanding these concepts and the
damage they cause, individuals can make more informed political
choices---whether voting, protesting, or simply debating ideas with
friends and family.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="historical-backdrop"><strong>Historical Backdrop</strong><a href="#historical-backdrop" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to historical-backdrop" title="Direct link to historical-backdrop">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="authoritarian-examples"><strong>Authoritarian Examples</strong><a href="#authoritarian-examples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to authoritarian-examples" title="Direct link to authoritarian-examples">​</a></h3>
<p>Authoritarian leaders often claim to act in the &quot;national interest&quot;
while limiting freedoms to keep control. For instance, <strong>General Augusto
Pinochet</strong> in Chile (1973--1990) seized power in a military coup. He
banned political parties and used fear to silence anyone critical of his
rule. Thousands were imprisoned, tortured, or disappeared, leaving
ordinary citizens scared to voice even slight disagreement. The promise
of &quot;stability&quot; came at the expense of human rights, especially for
people deemed suspicious or disloyal.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="totalitarian-examples"><strong>Totalitarian Examples</strong><a href="#totalitarian-examples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to totalitarian-examples" title="Direct link to totalitarian-examples">​</a></h3>
<p>Under totalitarian regimes, the government tries to direct virtually all
aspects of life. <strong>Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union</strong> is a classic case.
Leaders set strict economic goals called &quot;Five-Year Plans,&quot; controlling
agriculture and factories. Dissidents and even innocent bystanders could
be sent to labor camps (the Gulag) over minor infractions, rumors, or
alleged disloyalty. The fear of being spied on by neighbors or
co-workers was constant. Such all-encompassing power locked people into
rigid roles, stifling creativity and preventing open debate.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fascist-examples"><strong>Fascist Examples</strong><a href="#fascist-examples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to fascist-examples" title="Direct link to fascist-examples">​</a></h3>
<p>Fascist states combine authoritarian power with extreme nationalism.
Under <strong>Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy</strong>, citizens had to conform to the
regime&#x27;s ideals of national pride. Likewise, in <strong>Adolf Hitler&#x27;s
Germany</strong>, fascism was tied to racist beliefs, culminating in the
persecution and genocide of Jewish communities and other groups.
Promises of unity led to the marginalization of any person not fitting
the desired &quot;national&quot; image. This created a society where criticizing
the leader or championing tolerance was a serious risk to one&#x27;s safety
and freedom.</p>

<p>Although some might think oppressive regimes belong only to history,
forms of authoritarianism, totalitarianism, and fascism persist today:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Tight Media Control:</strong> In certain nations, state-run media outlets
broadcast nothing but praise for the government. Independent
journalists face harassment, arrests, or disappearances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Surveillance Technology:</strong> Thanks to modern tools like facial
recognition and social media monitoring, governments can watch
citizens more closely than ever before. Even everyday conversations
on messaging apps can be flagged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Political Repression:</strong> In some countries, elections happen but
are rigged. Opposition candidates are barred from running, or the
vote count is manipulated. Voters who speak out risk job loss or
even arrest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ethnic Persecution:</strong> Some regimes promote aggressive nationalist
identities, targeting minority groups by denying them official
documents, work permits, or basic social services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact on Individuals:</strong> People living under these modern regimes
often find themselves cut off from unbiased information, pressured to
attend government rallies, or forced to support certain policies out of
fear. A regular person might lose a business license or scholarship
simply for failing to demonstrate loyalty. Others who once believed they
were &quot;apolitical&quot; can discover they are subject to scrutiny for social
media posts or casual remarks that the authorities view as suspicious.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ways-these-systems-harm-everyday-life"><strong>Ways These Systems Harm Everyday Life</strong><a href="#ways-these-systems-harm-everyday-life" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ways-these-systems-harm-everyday-life" title="Direct link to ways-these-systems-harm-everyday-life">​</a></h2>
<p>Authoritarian, totalitarian, and fascist governments don&#x27;t just affect
&quot;political&quot; people; they permeate all aspects of daily living. Below are
some of the key ways a person can suffer under oppressive rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Censorship of Media and Arts:</strong> Citizens may only see news that
favors those in power. Artists can be forced to hide or destroy
works that question the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Politicized Education:</strong> Textbooks must teach glorified or
distorted versions of history. Teachers who resist these lessons
risk losing their jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restricted Travel:</strong> Travel permits may be required. A young
graduate might be denied a passport for fear they&#x27;ll learn
&quot;dangerous ideas&quot; abroad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mandatory Military Service:</strong> Individuals can be conscripted for
extended periods, halting education or careers in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loss of Professional Licensing:</strong> A doctor or lawyer might lose
the right to practice if they criticize the ruling elite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diminished Worker Protections:</strong> Because labor unions are banned
or controlled, employees face unsafe conditions and low wages
without recourse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suppression of Civil Society:</strong> Voluntary groups---charities,
neighborhood associations, human rights organizations---are shut
down if they aren&#x27;t aligned with the state&#x27;s goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Propaganda Saturation:</strong> Public spaces are filled with posters,
rallies, and broadcasts praising the leader or party. Over time,
even private opinions might be molded by constant exposure to state
messaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Institutionalized Violence<br>
<!-- -->**From an individual&#x27;s viewpoint, facing institutionalized violence
means living in constant dread of arbitrary arrest and brutal
interrogation. A simple trip to the market could end in being
questioned by government agents for a harmless remark overheard in
the street. When there is no independent judiciary, torture, forced
confessions, and &quot;disappearances&quot; become chillingly routine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Unchecked Corruption<br>
<!-- -->**A small-business owner confronts endless bribes demanded by local
officials. Even filing standard paperwork is a gamble; refusal to
pay could lead to shuttered stores, seized assets, or fabricated
legal charges. Ordinary people watch helplessly as their hard-earned
money lines the pockets of powerful elites, who rarely face
consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Forced Assimilation<br>
<!-- -->**A member of an ethnic minority is coerced into abandoning her
mother tongue, dress, and cultural traditions under the threat of
persecution. Familiar community celebrations vanish as the regime
suppresses any identity that challenges the dominant culture. She
loses touch not just with her heritage, but also with relatives too
fearful to practice their customs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Community Betrayal<br>
<!-- -->**A neighbor who once shared holiday dinners is pressured by
authorities to spy on friends for &quot;anti-state sentiments.&quot; Paranoia
grips everyday relationships, and genuine trust becomes scarce.
People turn on one another to appear loyal, leaving a formerly
close-knit community splintered by fear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Academic and Intellectual Stagnation<br>
<!-- -->**A promising researcher&#x27;s ideas are thwarted by strict censorship
and banned topics. Securing funding depends on conforming to the
regime&#x27;s agenda, forcing her to abandon innovative projects. Her
peers either self-censor or flee abroad, robbing the community of
advancements in science, literature, and the arts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Generational Trauma<br>
<!-- -->**A parent who survived violent crackdowns remains haunted by
memories of repression, passing on fear and distrust to their
children. Even decades later, the family avoids candid discussions
and political participation, convinced it is dangerous to question
authority. This inherited anxiety hinders personal growth and erodes
hope for the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Rigid Social Control<br>
<!-- -->**A young professional dreams of switching careers or moving to a
different city, only to discover that travel permits are tightly
restricted and job opportunities are contingent on state approval.
Individual choices---relating to marriage, religion, or even
fashion---face scrutiny. Nonconformity can trigger professional
setbacks or surveillance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Sanitized History and Propaganda<br>
<!-- -->**A history teacher is forced to use textbooks that glorify the
regime&#x27;s founder and conceal state-sanctioned atrocities. In class,
she avoids revealing real events for fear of being reported by
students or colleagues. The next generation grows up with a warped
version of their national past, stripped of any genuine lessons from
history&#x27;s errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Escalation to Atrocity<br>
<!-- -->**A woman from a marginalized group gradually sees hateful rhetoric
escalate into laws justifying mass arrests. Before long, she
witnesses neighbors being taken from their homes or worse. In the
absence of checks on power, brutal campaigns---once
unthinkable---gain official sanction. She realizes too late that her
life itself hangs by a thread, while the rest of the world looks on
in horror.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> When these barriers to free expression and movement
pile up, the potential of each individual shrinks. An environment filled
with suspicion and fear leaves citizens uncertain, unable to explore new
ideas or trust their neighbors. The creative, social, and intellectual
energy that might have thrived in a more open society fades away.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted Groups and Victims of State Violence</strong></p>
<p>A major tactic in oppressive regimes is to pick certain communities as
&quot;enemies&quot; to rally the majority behind the state:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Minority Persecution:</strong> Ethnic or religious minorities may face
constant hostility, with hateful language encouraged by state media.
A tailor belonging to the &quot;wrong&quot; group might lose clients due to
official propaganda labeling her community as threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gender and Sexual Orientation Discrimination:</strong> Authoritarian and
fascist governments often impose rigid social norms, making it
dangerous for LGBTQ+ individuals or those who deviate from
traditional gender roles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forced Relocation:</strong> Entire neighborhoods can be evicted to
&quot;sanitize&quot; areas or reserve land for loyal supporters. Families who
have lived on the same property for generations can be forced to
move to remote regions with poor living conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Violence Against Protesters:</strong> Police or military are used to
break up peaceful demonstrations. Even bystanders can be arrested
for simply being nearby.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Individual Consequences:</strong> Anyone could become a victim without having
done anything wrong. A student returning from overseas might be detained
because their foreign connections seem &quot;suspicious.&quot; A bus driver could
be branded a troublemaker after complaining about poor road maintenance
during a local gathering. The presence of widespread violence and
intimidation means personal safety can never be guaranteed, no matter
how uncontroversial one&#x27;s daily life may seem.</p>

<p>Authoritarian and totalitarian leaders often practice kleptocracy, a
system where they and their allies enrich themselves at the expense of
the public. Businesses must pay extra &quot;fees&quot; to keep operating, and
officials demand bribes for basic services. As money flows into private
pockets, infrastructure and public welfare programs decline.</p>

compete in markets dominated by government-aligned companies.</p>
</li>

<p>Consider a young woman, Layla, who dreams of starting a bakery. In a
democratic country, she could take out a loan, open her shop, and simply
face normal competition. Under an authoritarian regime, however, Layla
might be refused a loan unless she bribes an official. She could also be
forced to display government slogans in her store or risk losing her
operating permit. If she criticizes these demands, Layla might see her
license revoked overnight.</p>

<p>These regimes often begin by promising law and order, using fear of
crime or social unrest as a justification for tight control. On the
surface, having a strong leader decide everything can seem efficient.
Yet concentrating power in a few hands makes it easy to crush any
opposition, leading to heavier censorship, arbitrary detentions, and
extreme punishments.</p>

<p>In democratic societies, courts, free press, and competitive elections
act as guardrails. If leaders abuse power, there are methods for
removal. Authoritarian, totalitarian, and fascist systems remove or
weaken these checks. Judges become political tools, elections are
rigged, and independent media is outlawed. People may initially feel
&quot;safe&quot; because they see fewer public disputes. In truth, they are not
free from danger; they are just less able to express dissatisfaction or
receive help.</p>

<p>Oppressive regimes often encourage citizens to inform on neighbors,
friends, or even family who might harbor &quot;traitorous&quot; views. Over time,
this fosters an atmosphere where everyone is afraid of being reported.
Genuine friendships fade under suspicion. High levels of surveillance
and propaganda warp social bonds, as no one dares to share honest
thoughts. This chilling effect is more damaging than many realize---once
trust dissolves, rebuilding it is extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Authoritarian, totalitarian, and fascist forms of governance all pose
serious threats to personal liberty, community well-being, and honest
public life. Whether we look at historical examples like Stalin&#x27;s purges
or modern incidents of internet shutdowns and forced relocations, the
pattern remains consistent: a small group in power exploits national
resources, silences opposition, and sows fear. Those who think they are
safe might find themselves targeted by false accusations, arbitrary
laws, or prejudice.</p>
<p>In a functioning democracy, people can join labor unions, form social
groups, publish independent media, and hold leaders accountable in
elections. While democracies are not perfect---they face corruption,
political disagreements, and policy failures---they at least allow room
for individuals to raise concerns, seek justice, and push for better
laws. When an oppressive regime takes hold, these avenues shrink or
disappear entirely, leaving ordinary citizens with no peaceful way to
advocate for change.</p>
<p>Voting for or supporting authoritarian, totalitarian, or fascist leaders
means handing them near-absolute control over your life and the lives of
people around you. The short-term promise of security or efficiency
often gives way to a reality where basic freedoms vanish, economic and
social hardships grow, and fear becomes the glue that holds the system
together. History teaches that once these freedoms are lost, regaining
them can be long and costly. By preserving democracy and staying
vigilant, we safeguard the right to think, speak, and hope---a right
that oppressive regimes all too eagerly take away.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="democracy-introduction"><strong>Democracy Introduction</strong><a href="#democracy-introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to democracy-introduction" title="Direct link to democracy-introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>Democracy is a form of government in which power rests with the people
rather than a single ruler or small group. This system usually features
regular elections, multiple political parties, and laws that protect
individual rights. While no government is perfect, democracies stand out
for giving citizens a voice in how their country is run.</p>
<p>When people think about democracy, they often imagine voting in
elections. But democracy involves much more than casting a ballot every
few years. It relies on values such as freedom of speech, equality
before the law, and peaceful debate. These principles can help a society
stay stable and adaptable, even when disagreements arise. In short,
democracy is &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people,&quot;
as famously described by Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="individual-freedoms-and-rights"><strong>Individual Freedoms and Rights</strong><a href="#individual-freedoms-and-rights" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to individual-freedoms-and-rights" title="Direct link to individual-freedoms-and-rights">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the most vital benefits of democracy is the protection of
personal liberties. In democratic nations, individuals can:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Speak Freely: People have the right to express their thoughts and
criticisms of the government without fear of harsh punishment. This
open dialogue pushes society forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assemble Peacefully: Groups can hold gatherings, form associations,
or protest injustices. This allows different voices to unite in
advocating for new laws or social reforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access Information: Free press and independent media ensure citizens
are not forced to rely solely on government-issued statements. This
encourages transparency and informed decision-making.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These rights help safeguard minority groups and those who might
otherwise be overlooked. In a functioning democracy, laws are generally
designed to protect every citizen&#x27;s freedoms, including the freedom to
worship according to one&#x27;s beliefs, form private organizations, and
publish independent ideas. Such openness cultivates a society where
creativity and cultural diversity can flourish.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="checks-and-balances"><strong>Checks and Balances</strong><a href="#checks-and-balances" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to checks-and-balances" title="Direct link to checks-and-balances">​</a></h2>
<p>Democracy also relies on a division of power among different branches of
government---often the executive (president or prime minister),
legislative (parliament or congress), and judicial (court systems). This
setup is commonly called &quot;checks and balances.&quot; Each branch can limit or
&quot;check&quot; the actions of the others, ensuring that no single part of
government becomes too powerful.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Executive: Proposes policies and implements laws, but must answer to
elected representatives and abide by court rulings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legislative: Makes laws, represents citizens&#x27; interests, and can
investigate or impeach the executive if wrongdoing occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Judiciary: Interprets laws, protects constitutional rights, and can
strike down laws or policies that violate the nation&#x27;s constitution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These checks and balances keep leaders accountable. A president, for
example, cannot simply pass any law they wish. Instead, they must gain
support from both lawmakers and the public. Similarly, courts can ensure
new laws do not conflict with constitutional principles. In this way,
democracy lowers the risks of corruption or abuse of power.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="historical-examples-of-democratic-success"><strong>Historical Examples of Democratic Success</strong><a href="#historical-examples-of-democratic-success" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to historical-examples-of-democratic-success" title="Direct link to historical-examples-of-democratic-success">​</a></h2>
<p>Throughout history, democratic systems have often proven more stable and
responsive to citizens than more authoritarian forms of government.
Let&#x27;s consider two examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Post-War Germany: After World War II, West Germany established a
democratic system with strong protections for individual rights and
a careful division of government powers. This helped the nation
rebuild economically and socially. Over time, as East and West
Germany reunited, democratic institutions guided a peaceful
transition, creating one of Europe&#x27;s most prosperous countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>United States Civil Rights Movement: Although the United States did
not always grant equal rights to all citizens, the democratic
process allowed for activism, debate, and legislation that advanced
civil rights for African Americans. Leaders like Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. used peaceful protests and legal challenges---tools that
democracy makes possible---to push for real change. Over time,
democratic institutions helped transform discriminatory laws,
showing how a society can improve itself through open dialogue and
voting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases, democracy offered ways for the public to address
problems, pass new laws, and hold officials accountable. Though progress
is not always quick or easy, democratic structures permit gradual
changes that often lead to greater fairness and stability in the long
run.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fostering-innovation-and-cooperation"><strong>Fostering Innovation and Cooperation</strong><a href="#fostering-innovation-and-cooperation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to fostering-innovation-and-cooperation" title="Direct link to fostering-innovation-and-cooperation">​</a></h2>
<p>When citizens have the freedom to think, speak, and collaborate openly,
it encourages progress and creativity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Public Debate: People from different backgrounds can share
perspectives, leading to new ideas that might be overlooked under
strict one-party rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Academic Research: Universities and think tanks are free to pursue
studies that may challenge existing policies. This openness helps
drive scientific breakthroughs and social reforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entrepreneurship: Democracy tends to allow open markets where
individuals can start businesses without needing a special favor
from a powerful ruler. This competitive environment boosts
innovation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In many successful democracies, people are free to form companies,
nonprofits, or media outlets. While there can be economic challenges,
this open environment fosters a spirit of healthy competition, driving
advancements in technology, healthcare, and cultural expression.
Meanwhile, regular elections allow voters to choose leaders who value
education and innovation, a process that can shape the nation&#x27;s
priorities.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-role-of-compromise"><strong>The Role of Compromise</strong><a href="#the-role-of-compromise" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-role-of-compromise" title="Direct link to the-role-of-compromise">​</a></h2>
<p>A common complaint about democracy is that it involves endless debate,
which can slow decision-making. But this debate, and the compromise that
usually follows, is precisely what makes democracy effective in the long
term. Different segments of society---farmers, urban dwellers, teachers,
students, retirees---each have unique concerns. Through public hearings,
media discussions, and legislative votes, these varying interests are
heard.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Seeking Middle Ground: Rather than forcing one group&#x27;s will on
everyone, democratic governments encourage stakeholders to find a
middle path. This means policies are more likely to address multiple
perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing Tension: By allowing open disagreement, democratic
societies can resolve conflicts before they become violent. Citizens
can vote to remove unpopular leaders, rather than resorting to
uprisings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While compromise might not always please everyone immediately, it helps
maintain unity and respect among citizens. People may be disappointed by
certain outcomes, but they still have the chance to push for change in
future elections, without risking widespread oppression or violence.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-democracy-matters-1"><strong>Why Democracy Matters</strong><a href="#why-democracy-matters-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-democracy-matters-1" title="Direct link to why-democracy-matters-1">​</a></h2>
<p>Democracy gives people a voice in shaping their future. It protects
individual freedoms, allows for open debate, and establishes checks on
power. Though democratic systems can experience setbacks---from
partisanship to economic downturns---they are built to let citizens
continue pushing for improvement. This flexibility fosters social trust
and cooperation, helping nations adapt to changing conditions.</p>
<p>In contrast to authoritarian, totalitarian, or fascist regimes that rely
on fear or violent force to maintain control, democracies encourage
active public participation. Voters, journalists, activists, and
everyday people each play a role in guiding policy decisions. Over time,
this collective effort drives progress and reduces the chance of
unchecked abuse of power.</p>
<p>In essence, democracy is about believing that no single person or group
should hold all authority. Instead, decision-making is shared among the
people, ensuring diverse voices are heard and respected. When citizens
take advantage of their rights to vote, speak out, and organize
peacefully, they safeguard democracy and protect the freedoms that help
societies grow and prosper.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/unitedprogressparty/firstpub-Platform/tree/main/docs/1.
