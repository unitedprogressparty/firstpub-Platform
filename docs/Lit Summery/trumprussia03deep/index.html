<p>Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was <strong>â€œsweeping and systemic,â€</strong> according to Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=Russia%20engaged%20in%20extensive%20attacks,election%20system%20in%202016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). The Russian government carried out a multi-pronged attack on the U.S. election: a cyber-hacking operation and an online propaganda campaign. In early 2016, Russian military intelligence (the GRU) hacked into Democratic Party servers (including the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podestaâ€™s emails) and later <strong>leaked thousands of stolen documents</strong> via fronts like â€œGuccifer 2.0â€ and WikiLeaks (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). At the same time, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Kremlin-linked troll farm, ran an <strong>â€œinformation warfareâ€ social media campaign that <strong>favored</strong> Donald Trump</strong> while sowing discord among U.S. voters (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,information%20for%20millions%20of%20registered" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). Russian operatives posed as Americans on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to spread disinformation, exacerbate social divisions, and support Trumpâ€™s candidacy over Hillary Clinton (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,information%20for%20millions%20of%20registered" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). U.S. intelligence concluded that President Vladimir Putin <strong>ordered this interference</strong> to hurt Clinton and help elect Trump (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20found%20irrefutable%20evidence%20of,was%20a%20%E2%80%9Choax%E2%80%9D%C2%A0perpetrated%20by%20Democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>).</p>
<p>Russian hackers also targeted state and local election systems in 2016. They probed election-related networks in at least 21 states and successfully penetrated Illinoisâ€™s voter registration database, stealing personal data of millions of voters (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=related%20databases%20and%20release%20of,78" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). However, there is no evidence that any votes were altered. The main impact of the interference was the damaging release of internal Democratic emails and the widespread propagation of false or divisive narratives online, which together <strong>undermined Clintonâ€™s campaign and boosted Trump</strong> (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). In a notorious July 2016 press conference, Trump even <strong>publicly called on Russia to hack Clintonâ€™s emails</strong> (â€œRussia, if youâ€™re listeningâ€¦â€), which Russian operatives attempted to do that same day, according to Muellerâ€™s findings (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=Russia%20engaged%20in%20extensive%20attacks,election%20system%20in%202016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>) (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>).</p>

<p>Despite Trumpâ€™s repeated claims during the campaign that he had â€œnothing to do with Russia,â€ investigators documented numerous financial and personal links between Trumpâ€™s circle and Russian interests (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=MIAMI%2FMOSCOW%20%E2%80%93%20During%20the%202016,has%20been%20even%20more%20emphatic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings</a>) (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C,documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings</a>). In 2015â€“2016, while running for president, <strong>Trump pursued a lucrative Trump Tower Moscow real estate project</strong>. His lawyer Michael Cohen engaged with Russian developers and even reached out to the Kremlin for assistance, and Trump himself signed a Letter of Intent during the campaign (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,that%20was%20%E2%80%9Cpart%20of%20Russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). This deal, had it succeeded, could have brought Trump Organization millions, suggesting a potential financial incentive for friendly relations with Russia. Cohen later admitted he lied to Congress about the projectâ€™s timing (falsely claiming it ended early in 2016) to downplay Trumpâ€™s business contact with Russia during the campaign (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,law%20enforcement%20authorities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>).</p>
<p>Trump also had past business connections involving Russian money. A 2017 Reuters investigation found that <strong>at least 63 Russian individuals or entities purchased nearly $100 million in Trump-branded real estate in Florida</strong> â€“ a sign of considerable Russian investment in Trumpâ€™s properties (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C,documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings</a>). Several wealthy Russians â€“ not from Putinâ€™s inner circle but still politically connected â€“ were among the condo owners in Trump buildings (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings</a>). In one high-profile deal, Trump in 2008 sold a Palm Beach mansion to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev for <strong>$95 million</strong>, double what Trump paid just a few years earlier (<a href="http://swalwell.house.gov/issues/russia-trump-his-administration-s-ties#:~:text=Russia%3A%20Trump%20%26%20His%20Team%27s,during%20a%20bankruptcy%20sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia: Trump &amp; His Team&#x27;s Ties - Eric Swalwell - House.gov</a>). These transactions, while not illegal, raised questions about Trumpâ€™s reliance on Russian funds in his business empire.</p>
<p>Personal relationships also linked Trumpâ€™s world to Russia. Trump visited Moscow for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, where he forged friendly ties with Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov and mused about building in Moscow (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,that%20was%20%E2%80%9Cpart%20of%20Russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). In June 2016, Trumpâ€™s eldest son, Don Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort <strong>met with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower</strong> after an intermediary (Agalarovâ€™s son) offered â€œofficial documents and information that would incriminate Hillaryâ€ as <strong>â€œpart of Russia and its governmentâ€™s support for Mr. Trumpâ€ (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=candidate%20Trump%20personally%20signed%20a,would%20release%20information%20damaging%20to" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>).</strong> Emails later made public showed Trump Jr. responding, â€œI love it,â€ when told of this Russian government effort to help his fatherâ€™s campaign. While the meeting did not ultimately yield clear dirt on Clinton, it is a stark example of the Trump campaignâ€™s willingness to accept Russian assistance (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=candidate%20Trump%20personally%20signed%20a,the%20Report%20that%20remains%20heavily" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>).</p>
<p>Multiple Trump <strong>campaign advisers had Russian contacts</strong> during 2016. Paul <strong>Manafort</strong>, who had extensive business in Ukraine and ties to pro-Kremlin figures, shared internal campaign polling data with <strong>Konstantin Kilimnik</strong>, a man the Senate later identified as a <strong>Russian intelligence officer</strong> (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=Manafort%20shared%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20internal,election%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%20said" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>). According to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Manafortâ€™s sharing of sensitive campaign data with a Russian operative represented a serious counterintelligence threat (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=Manafort%20shared%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20internal,election%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%20said" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>). Another adviser, <strong>George Papadopoulos</strong>, was told by a Russia-linked intermediary in spring 2016 that Russia had â€œdirtâ€ in the form of Clinton emails, months before WikiLeaks released hacked emails. Papadopoulos later lied to the FBI about his contacts and pleaded guilty to perjury (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,law%20enforcement%20authorities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). And future National Security Adviser <strong>Michael Flynn</strong> had secret communications with Russiaâ€™s ambassador in December 2016 discussing U.S. sanctions, for which Flynn also lied to investigators (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,law%20enforcement%20authorities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). These numerous links and contacts were later summarized by Muellerâ€™s report, which <strong>â€œidentified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaignâ€</strong> â€“ contacts that the campaign <strong>â€œwelcomedâ€</strong> even if an explicit criminal conspiracy was not established (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=The%20investigation%20%E2%80%9Cidentified%20numerous%20links,potential%20to%20damage%20candidate%20Clinton%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>) (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,law%20enforcement%20authorities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>).</p>

<p>During his 2016 campaign and subsequent presidency, Trump often struck a conciliatory tone toward Russia, and some of his policies or actions aligned with Kremlin interests. Notably, <strong>Trumpâ€™s team intervened in the Republican Partyâ€™s 2016 platform to soften language on Ukraine</strong>, opposing a provision that would have called for providing lethal defensive weapons to help Ukraine fight Russian-backed forces (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/08/republicans-russia-platform-fight-244672#:~:text=Congressional%20investigators%20have%20interviewed%20ex,some%20of%20those%20sources%20said" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia investigators probe 2016 GOP platform fight - POLITICO</a>) (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/08/republicans-russia-platform-fight-244672#:~:text=The%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20position%20in,fight%20came%20as%20a%20surprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia investigators probe 2016 GOP platform fight - POLITICO</a>). The platform was changed to offer only â€œappropriate assistanceâ€ and greater coordination with NATO, a more Russia-friendly stance (<a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2016/aug/04/did-trump-campaign-soften-platform-language-benefi/#:~:text=While%20the%20original%20version%20of,coordination%20with%20NATO%20defense%20planning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PolitiFact | Did Trump campaign soften platform language to benefit Russia?</a>). This move â€“ highly unusual for a GOP normally hawkish on Russia â€“ surprised many and was viewed as effectively <strong>watering down support for Ukraine to Russiaâ€™s benefit</strong> (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/08/republicans-russia-platform-fight-244672#:~:text=The%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20position%20in,fight%20came%20as%20a%20surprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia investigators probe 2016 GOP platform fight - POLITICO</a>).</p>
<p>Once in office, President Trump repeatedly showed reluctance to criticize Putin or fully embrace the findings of Russian election meddling. In July 2018, at a summit in Helsinki, Finland, Trump openly <strong>sided with Putinâ€™s denials of interference over U.S. intelligence agenciesâ€™ conclusions</strong>. Standing beside Putin, Trump said <strong>â€œI donâ€™t see any reason why it would be [Russia]â€</strong> that meddled in 2016, adding that Putin was â€œextremely strong and powerful in his denialâ€ (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-putin-meeting-election-meddling-722424#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20people%20came%20to%20me%2C,%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump: â€˜I donâ€™t see any reason whyâ€™ Russia would have interfered with election - POLITICO</a>) (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-putin-meeting-election-meddling-722424#:~:text=Trump%20refused%20to%20confront%20Putin,intelligence%20agencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump: â€˜I donâ€™t see any reason whyâ€™ Russia would have interfered with election - POLITICO</a>). This shocking statement â€“ effectively rejecting his own intelligence communityâ€™s unanimous assessment â€“ was widely condemned in the U.S. as a capitulation to Moscowâ€™s narrative. (Trump later tried to walk back the remark amid backlash.) Putin, for his part, admitted in Helsinki that he <strong>wanted Trump to win in 2016</strong> (because of Trumpâ€™s stated desire for better U.S.-Russia relations) (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-putin-meeting-election-meddling-722424#:~:text=it%20would%20be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump: â€˜I donâ€™t see any reason whyâ€™ Russia would have interfered with election - POLITICO</a>). Trumpâ€™s public trust in Putin over U.S. officials not only emboldened Moscow but also <em>signaled to Russia a lack of serious repercussions</em> for its election interference.</p>
<p>Trumpâ€™s foreign policy often dovetailed with Russian preferences. He frequently disparaged NATO â€“ calling it â€œobsoleteâ€ and complaining that U.S. allies werenâ€™t paying enough â€“ undermining the allianceâ€™s unity at a time when Russia sought a weaker NATO. In 2017, reports emerged that Trump had discussed the possibility of withdrawing the U.S. from NATO, causing alarm in European capitals and delight in Moscow (though no withdrawal occurred). The Trump administration also <strong>delayed or opposed sanctions on Russia</strong>. After Congress passed tough new sanctions on Russia in 2017 (for election meddling and aggression in Ukraine) by an overwhelming margin, Trump signed the bill reluctantly and then slow-walked its implementation (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20found%20irrefutable%20evidence%20of,was%20a%20%E2%80%9Choax%E2%80%9D%C2%A0perpetrated%20by%20Democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>). In 2018, his administration lifted sanctions on a Russian oligarchâ€™s companies (after that oligarch agreed to reduce his ownership stakes), a move critics said rewarded Putinâ€™s associate. And in his final year, Trump attempted to invite Russia back into the G7 (making it the G8 again), despite its continued occupation of Crimea â€“ a proposal U.S. allies rejected.</p>
<p>Perhaps most dramatically, in 2019 Trump <strong>froze nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine</strong> while pressuring Ukraineâ€™s president to investigate Joe Biden. This led to Trumpâ€™s first impeachment for abuse of power (<a href="https://americanoversight.org/new-records-further-highlight-trumps-role-in-withholding-ukraine-aid/#:~:text=,military%20aid%20to%20Ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Records Further Highlight Trump&#x27;s Role in Withholding Ukraine ...</a>). The aid was vital for Ukraineâ€™s defense against Russian aggression, and withholding it was seen as directly benefitting Moscowâ€™s strategic position. As one Republican senator later noted, <strong>â€œThe Kremlin has been normalized in diplomacy that excludes Ukraineâ€¦ and they gave up nothing to get thatâ€ (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>)</strong>, underscoring how moves like delaying aid or sidelining Ukraine work to Russiaâ€™s advantage. Although the aid hold was eventually lifted under public and congressional pressure, the episode signaled to Russia that U.S. support for Ukraine was negotiable under Trump â€“ aligning with Putinâ€™s interests in undermining Ukraineâ€™s security.</p>
<p>Despite some tougher actions (for example, Trump did approve limited arms sales to Ukraine earlier in his term and expelled dozens of Russian diplomats after the UK chemical weapon attack), the overall tenor of Trumpâ€™s presidency was accommodating to Russia. Moscow benefited from <strong>divisions in the West</strong> that Trump exacerbated, and from an American president who often questioned the value of alliances and echoed Kremlin talking points. U.S. intelligence officials and military leaders grew concerned that Trumpâ€™s approach was emboldening Russia. As H.R. McMaster, Trumpâ€™s own former National Security Advisor, warned in 2020: by downplaying Russian aggression, <strong>Trump was â€œaiding and abetting Putinâ€™s effortsâ€</strong> to disrupt the U.S. and its allies (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=H,117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>Allegations of links between the Trump campaign and Russia led to multiple investigations. The most significant was Special Counsel Robert <strong>Muellerâ€™s investigation (2017â€“2019)</strong>, which resulted in 34 indictments, including Russian operatives and several Trump associates (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=The%20Special%20Counsel%20investigation%20uncovered,extensive%20criminal%20activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). In his March 2019 report, Mueller confirmed that <strong>Russia had interfered in 2016 in a â€œsweeping and systematic fashionâ€</strong> (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=Russia%20engaged%20in%20extensive%20attacks,election%20system%20in%202016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>), and documented â€œnumerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaignâ€ (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=The%20investigation%20%E2%80%9Cidentified%20numerous%20links,potential%20to%20damage%20candidate%20Clinton%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). However, Mueller did <strong>not establish a criminal conspiracy</strong> between Trumpâ€™s team and Russia to influence the election (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=that%20during%20his%20first%20term%2C,Trump%20was%20tough%20on%20Russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). In legal terms, there wasnâ€™t sufficient evidence that Trump or his aides entered into a coordinated agreement with the Russian governmentâ€™s interference effort (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=that%20during%20his%20first%20term%2C,Trump%20was%20tough%20on%20Russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). Mueller pointedly noted, though, that the Trump campaign <em>expected</em> it would benefit from Russiaâ€™s actions, and the campaign **â€œshowed interest in WikiLeaksâ€™s releasesâ€ of hacked material and <strong>â€œwelcomed their potential to damageâ€</strong> Clinton (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=The%20investigation%20%E2%80%9Cidentified%20numerous%20links,potential%20to%20damage%20candidate%20Clinton%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>).</p>
<p>Mueller also investigated whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia probe. The report outlined <strong>ten episodes of potential obstruction</strong> by President Trump (such as trying to fire Mueller and urging aides to lie) and explicitly <strong>did not exonerate</strong> him (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=Special%20Counsel%20Mueller%20declined%20to,he%20engaged%20in%20obstructive%20conduct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). Over 1,000 former federal prosecutors signed a statement that Trumpâ€™s conduct would have led to indictment for obstruction were he not a sitting president (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=,efforts%20to%20impede%20federal%20proceedings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). Ultimately, Department of Justice policy barred charging a sitting president, and Mueller deferred a judgment on prosecution. Attorney General William Barrâ€™s interpretation of the report in 2019 (clearing Trump of obstruction and highlighting â€œno collusionâ€) was controversial and, many argued, downplayed the gravity of Muellerâ€™s actual findings (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=that%20during%20his%20first%20term%2C,Trump%20was%20tough%20on%20Russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>).</p>
<p>In parallel, <strong>Congressional investigations</strong> dug into Trump-Russia links. The bipartisan <strong>Senate Intelligence Committee</strong> conducted a three-year inquiry, releasing its final volume in August 2020. The Senate report went further than Mueller in some respects, declaring that the Trump campaignâ€™s contacts with Russians <strong>posed a â€œgraveâ€ counterintelligence threat to the United States</strong> (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=The%20Senate%20Intelligence%20Committee%20on,Moscow%20posed%20a%20%E2%80%9Cgrave%E2%80%9D%C2%A0counterintelligence%20threat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>). Republican Senator Marco Rubio, the acting committee chair, stated they found â€œirrefutable evidenceâ€ of Russiaâ€™s meddling in 2016, directly refuting Trumpâ€™s claims that the interference was a â€œhoaxâ€ (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20found%20irrefutable%20evidence%20of,was%20a%20%E2%80%9Choax%E2%80%9D%C2%A0perpetrated%20by%20Democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>). While the Senate, like Mueller, <em>did not allege</em> a coordination conspiracy, it detailed a â€œbreathtaking level of contactsâ€ between Trump associates and Russian officials (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=scheme%C2%A0between%20the%20Trump%20campaign%20and,Moscow%2C%20Rubio%20said" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>) (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=The%20nearly%201%2C000,Democrat%2C%20said%20in%20a%20statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>). For example, the Senate confirmed that <strong>Manafort shared internal polling data with a Russian intelligence-linked operative (Kilimnik)</strong> and that <strong>Kilimnik may have been connected to Russiaâ€™s hack-and-leak operations</strong>, raising the possibility of a tangible link between the campaign and Kremlin intelligence efforts (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=and%20worked%20with%20Konstantin%20Kilimnik%2C,intelligence%20officer%2C%20the%20report%20said" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>) (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=Manafort%20shared%20Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20internal,election%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%20said" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>). The committee concluded that Russian officials and proxies <strong>worked to influence the Trump team</strong>, and that their interactions â€œrepresented a grave counterintelligence threatâ€ to national security (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=match%20at%20L188%20particularly%20Kilimnik,grave%20counterintelligence%20threat%2C%E2%80%9D%C2%A0the%20report%20said" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>).</p>
<p>These investigations painted a clear picture: Russia <strong>intervened to help Trump</strong>, the Trump campaign <strong>had extensive interactions with Russians</strong>, and Trump <strong>often impeded inquiries</strong> into the matter. While no criminal conspiracy was charged, the pattern of contacts and Trumpâ€™s accommodating posture toward Moscow had a lasting impact. It sowed mistrust in U.S. institutions, led to Trumpâ€™s impeachment (unrelated to 2016 but involving Ukraine), and hardened the partisan divide over the Russia issue. Importantly, the U.S. governmentâ€™s unified response to Russian interference was hampered â€“ a fact not lost on Moscow. By 2020, as noted below, Russia was emboldened to continue its active measures, knowing domestic U.S. opinion on Russian meddling remained sharply split, with Trump frequently dismissing the issue.</p>

<p>In the 2020 election cycle, Russia again mounted information operations to influence the outcome â€“ this time against then-candidate Joe Biden and in support of President Trump. U.S. intelligence agencies warned Congress in <strong>February and August 2020</strong> that Russia was actively interfering in that yearâ€™s election <strong>â€œin Trumpâ€™s favor.â€</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=August%202020%2C%20United%20States%20Intelligence,2021%20that%20federal%20investigators%20in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). According to a declassified report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released after the election, <strong>Russian President Putin authorized influence operations aimed at denigrating Joe Biden</strong> and boosting Trumpâ€™s re-election (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=election%20%20in%20then,and%20former%20Ukrainian%20officials%20to" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). Unlike 2016, these efforts relied less on bold hacks-and-leaks and more on covert propaganda and the cultivation of U.S. political figures to launder disinformation.</p>
<p>A key element of Russiaâ€™s 2020 interference was the use of <strong>pro-Russian Ukrainian individuals and other proxies to spread misleading narratives about Biden</strong>. U.S. intelligence found that individuals linked to Russian intelligence fed unsubstantiated allegations about Bidenâ€™s family and Ukraine to American media and prominent Trump allies (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=election%20%20in%20then,and%20former%20Ukrainian%20officials%20to" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). Notably, <strong>Andrii Derkach</strong>, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician, released edited audio tapes and promoted corruption claims against Biden; the U.S. Treasury later designated Derkach as an â€œactive Russian agentâ€ for interfering in the election. These Russian-propagated claims made their way into the U.S. information ecosystem, including being echoed by Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=,Rudy%20Giuliani%20as%20a%20channel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). In fact, in late 2020, federal investigators launched a probe into whether several Ukrainians (with Russian backing) <strong>used Giuliani as a channel to spread disinformation about Biden</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=Biden%20%20,12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). This illustrates how Russiaâ€™s strategy evolved to <strong>launder propaganda through U.S. political actors</strong> and media, making it seem domestically sourced.</p>
<p>On social media, Russian influence operations continued, though tech companies were more vigilant after 2016. Russian operatives (including the IRA) created fake personas and even a sham online news outlet (the â€œNewsroom for American and European Based Citizensâ€) to target U.S. audiences with divisive content (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=Analysts%20and%20officials%20interviewed%20by,116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). They often <strong>amplified misleading statements from Trump himself</strong>, for example pushing false narratives about mail-in voting fraud that Trump was alleging in 2020 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=Analysts%20and%20officials%20interviewed%20by,116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). When mainstream platforms shut down many Russian troll accounts, the propaganda migrated to <strong>alternative platforms like Gab and Parler</strong>, where content moderation was looser (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=amplify%20misleading%20statements%20from%20Trump%2C,116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). A Reuters investigation in September 2020 noted that content from a Russian fake news operation, though banned on Twitter and Facebook, <strong>â€œgot more tractionâ€ on these fringe platforms favored by some of Trumpâ€™s base (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=amplify%20misleading%20statements%20from%20Trump%2C,116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>).</strong> Russian state media and bots also amplified hashtags and stories favorable to Trump or attacking Biden. By mirroring and magnifying Trumpâ€™s own talking points (for instance, casting doubt on the integrity of mail voting), Russian operatives made their disinformation less conspicuous and more effective.</p>
<p>Russian cyber activities in 2020 were ongoing as well. In September 2020, Microsoft revealed that Russian state-backed hackers attempted to breach the networks of at least one major campaign consulting firm working for Democrats (SKDKninckerbocker) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=On%20September%2010%2C%202020%2C%20Reuters,114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). The attack was thwarted, and no similar dramatic hack-and-dump operation like 2016â€™s emerged during the 2020 race. U.S. officials had publicly warned Russia (and other adversaries) against any direct hacking of election infrastructure or campaigns, and it appears Russia exercised more caution on that front. Instead, the emphasis was on <strong>disinformation and sowing distrust</strong>. Even as votes were being counted, U.S. officials flagged a surge of false narratives â€“ many originating from Russia or Iran â€“ aimed at undermining confidence in the election results and stoking social discord (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=On%20October%2021%2C%20threatening%20emails,In%20his%20announcement%20Ratcliffe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=said%20that%20Iran%27s%20intent%20had,remarks%20as%20signed%20off%20by" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). This included conspiracy theories around voter fraud that dovetailed with Trumpâ€™s premature claims of a â€œstolen election.â€</p>
<p>The <strong>impact of Russiaâ€™s 2020 efforts</strong> is hard to quantify, but they succeeded in injecting toxic themes into U.S. political discourse. For example, stories accusing Biden of corrupt ties to Ukraine (a narrative pushed by Russian agents) became a staple in right-wing media during the campaign. The infamous October 2020 <strong>â€œHunter Biden laptopâ€ story</strong> â€“ which raised allegations about Bidenâ€™s son â€“ was seized upon by Trump and Russian outlets alike. U.S. authorities reportedly investigated whether that episode had Russian disinfo connections (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=Further%20information%3A%20New%20York%20Post,%C2%A7%20Hunter%20Biden%20laptop%20story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>), though as of 2021 they had not concluded it was a foreign operation. Even so, Russian state media amplified the laptop saga extensively to tarnish Biden.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, Trump ultimately lost the 2020 election, and Biden became president. A March 2021 U.S. intelligence assessment stated that while Russia <em>had</em> tried to influence the election for Trump, <strong>no foreign actor compromised the voting process or results</strong>. However, the legacy of Russiaâ€™s 2020 interference was a further erosion of shared truth in American politics. After the election, Russian propaganda outlets amplified Trumpâ€™s false claims of election fraud (the â€œStop the Stealâ€ narrative), contributing to an atmosphere of suspicion that culminated in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. In sum, Russiaâ€™s 2020 interference, though perhaps less visibly dramatic than in 2016, remained a significant factor in U.S. politics â€“ one that <strong>reinforced Kremlin objectives by deepening Americaâ€™s internal divisions</strong> and keeping alive Moscowâ€™s preferred candidateâ€™s message even after defeat.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="influence-on-us-political-narratives-and-response">Influence on U.S. Political Narratives and Response<a href="#influence-on-us-political-narratives-and-response" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Influence on U.S. Political Narratives and Response" title="Direct link to Influence on U.S. Political Narratives and Response">​</a></h3>
<p>Throughout 2020, Russian information operations tailored their messages to U.S. audiencesâ€™ hot-button issues. Beyond the election itself, Russia sought to inflame tensions around racial justice protests, the COVID-19 pandemic, and trust in democratic institutions. For instance, Russian-linked trolls promoted polarized content about Black Lives Matter and law-and-order themes, aiming to pit Americans against each other. They also spread conspiracy theories about COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccines, aligning at times with narratives from the far-right in the U.S. Such efforts werenâ€™t focused solely on electing Trump but on <strong>widening rifts in American society</strong>, which would benefit Russia no matter who won.</p>
<p>U.S. agencies took a more aggressive stance against foreign influence in 2020 compared to 2016. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security frequently issued public service announcements about disinformation. In October 2020, for example, top officials <strong>â€œpre-bunkedâ€</strong> potential misinformation by warning that any unexpected claims of hacked or leaked voting data in the final days could be part of a foreign plot. Social media companies also coordinated with law enforcement to take down fake accounts linked to Russia. In one notable case, Facebook in September 2020 removed a small network of accounts tied to the IRA that was posing as an independent news site for conservatives (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=Analysts%20and%20officials%20interviewed%20by,116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Bipartisan coalitions in Congress remained concerned about Russiaâ€™s continued interference. The fact that the <strong>Senate Intelligence Committee explicitly noted</strong> in its August 2020 report addendum that some information was directly relevant to <strong>â€œRussiaâ€™s interference in the 2020 electionâ€</strong> (but was classified) shows that lawmakers saw a through-line from 2016 to 2020 (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=opinion%2C%20the%20Obama%20administration%E2%80%99s%20failures,intelligence%20agencies%E2%80%99%C2%A0assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>). Indeed, Senator Ron Wyden warned that the counterintelligence threats surrounding Trump were <em>ongoing</em> in 2020 (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference-2016-election-report/#:~:text=opinion%2C%20the%20Obama%20administration%E2%80%99s%20failures,intelligence%20agencies%E2%80%99%C2%A0assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Intelligence Committee issues final report on Russian interference</a>). This likely alluded to how Russian agents were again trying to penetrate Trumpâ€™s inner circle (via proxies offering dirt on Biden). While Trump himself largely dismissed these warnings â€“ frequently calling the Russia issue a witch hunt â€“ career officials worked behind the scenes to safeguard the election.</p>
<p>In the end, the U.S. response mitigated some threats (no big cyberattack disrupted the voting process), but <strong>Russian disinformation still found fertile ground</strong>. A significant portion of the American electorate came to doubt the legitimacy of the 2020 result, a doubt that Russia eagerly stoked. As the U.S. moved toward the 2024 election, it did so carrying the baggage of years of Russian active measures that had helped polarize its politics. American security agencies braced for the possibility that 2024 would bring yet another chapter in Moscowâ€™s interference playbook, potentially even more fraught given Russiaâ€™s high stakes in that election (due to the ongoing war in Ukraine).</p>

<p>In 2024, Donald Trump campaigned for the presidency once more, and evidence suggests <strong>Russia again attempted to meddle in the election</strong>. U.S. officials asserted that Russian operatives carried out familiar influence tactics â€“ <strong>spreading disinformation and sowing discord</strong> â€“ during the 2024 campaign, with the apparent aim of supporting Trumpâ€™s return to power. According to U.S. intelligence assertions (which Moscow vehemently denied), Russia orchestrated online propaganda and covert social media activity to amplify divisive issues and undermine President Biden (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Moscow%20has%20also%20repeatedly%20denied,an%20attempt%20to%20sow%20chaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). As in previous elections, Russian state actors pushed narratives on U.S. platforms questioning the integrity of the election and highlighting controversies that might dampen support for Biden. Kremlin spokespersons and media also painted a negative picture of Bidenâ€™s policies (especially his stance on the Ukraine war), while often portraying Trump as a potential peacemaker who would be better for Russian interests.</p>
<p>In terms of cyber activity, by late 2024 there were reports of <strong>attempted intrusions into U.S. campaign infrastructure</strong> that were attributed to Russia. For example, in the summer of 2024, cybersecurity experts detected phishing attempts targeting staffers associated with the Biden campaign, believed to be launched by the same Russian hacking units that struck in 2016 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=On%20September%2010%2C%202020%2C%20Reuters,114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). These attempts were apparently unsuccessful or contained before damage was done, thanks to heightened security post-2016. Additionally, social media companies in 2024 removed clusters of inauthentic accounts linked to Russian sources, some of which impersonated American voters to inject extremist rhetoric into political discussions.</p>
<p>A notable focus of Russian influence in 2024 was the ongoing <strong>war in Ukraine</strong>. Russian propaganda channels heavily messaged the U.S. public that supporting Ukraine (a key Biden policy) was driving up American costs and risking conflict with Russia. In tandem, they echoed Trumpâ€™s pledges that he would end the war quickly if elected â€“ a narrative designed to make Trumpâ€™s candidacy appealing to war-weary or isolationist sentiments in the U.S. Intelligence analysts noted that Moscowâ€™s agents on social media promoted content arguing that Bidenâ€™s aid to Ukraine was wasteful or even provoked the war, effectively bolstering Trumpâ€™s criticism of Biden. In short, <strong>the Kremlin had a clear preference for Trump in 2024</strong>, expecting that a Trump victory would lead to a U.S. retrenchment from supporting Ukraine, which would strategically benefit Russia.</p>
<p>Indeed, after the 2024 U.S. election in which Trump was declared the winner, <strong>Russian officials openly celebrated the result</strong>. President Putin waited only a short time before congratulating Trump on his victory on November 7, 2024, and praised Trumpâ€™s <strong>â€œcourageâ€</strong> during the campaign (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=,is%20Russia%27s%20%27ally%27%2C%20Putin%20says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=,congratulate%20him%20on%20his%20election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). Putin highlighted Trumpâ€™s statements about <strong>ending the Ukraine crisis and restoring U.S.-Russia relations</strong>, calling them â€œdeserving of attentionâ€ and expressing hope for renewed dialogue (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Putin%20%20said%20remarks%20Trump,relations%20with%20Russia%20deserved%20attention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). The Kremlinâ€™s relief was palpable: after four years of Bidenâ€™s firm stance against Russia, Moscow anticipated a far more favorable environment. Russian state media hailed the outcome, and officials suggested that allegations of Trump being pro-Russia were nonsense, pointing out that Trump had been constrained by domestic opposition in his first term (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Russia%20and%20Trump%20have%20repeatedly,Trump%20was%20tough%20on%20Russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). Nonetheless, U.S. intelligence maintained that <strong>Russia had indeed meddled in 2024</strong>, following the pattern of previous elections (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Moscow%20has%20also%20repeatedly%20denied,an%20attempt%20to%20sow%20chaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). Putin and his government continued to deny any interference, even as American agencies reportedly began preparing a new post-election assessment on foreign influence in 2024.</p>

<p>Upon taking office in January 2025 for his second term, President Trump moved rapidly on foreign policy initiatives that marked a sharp departure from his predecessor â€“ and many of these moves directly <strong>benefited Russian interests</strong>. Foremost was Trumpâ€™s approach to the war in Ukraine. In his first weeks back in the White House, Trump sought to broker a rapid peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but <strong>on terms very favorable to the Kremlin</strong>. He organized high-level talks with Russia <em>without</em> Ukraine or NATO allies at the table, a format that alarmed observers. In February 2025, U.S. and Russian negotiators (including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and an inexperienced team of Trump aides) met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for initial peace discussions (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Washington%27s%20approach%20changed%20dramatically%20with,97" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=The%20senior%20negotiators%20met%20in,the%20talks%20got%20under%20way" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). Even before formal talks began, Trump signaled significant <strong>concessions</strong>: he publicly <strong>ruled out Ukrainian membership in NATO</strong> and stated it was â€œunrealisticâ€ for Ukraine to expect to recover all territory lost to Russia (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Even%20before%20the%20meeting%2C%20European,they%20said%20amounted%20to%20appeasement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). European allies criticized these as <strong>â€œfree giftsâ€ to Moscow</strong> â€“ effectively adopting Putinâ€™s red-lines in advance and undermining Ukraineâ€™s negotiating position (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Even%20before%20the%20meeting%2C%20European,they%20said%20amounted%20to%20appeasement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). Critics described Trumpâ€™s stance as <strong>appeasement</strong>, noting that Russia had given up nothing in exchange.</p>
<p>Trumpâ€™s own rhetoric during this period closely paralleled Kremlin talking points. In a startling comment, President Trump <strong>blamed Ukraine for â€œstartingâ€ the war</strong>, asserting that Kyivâ€™s actions provoked the 2022 Russian invasion â€“ a claim with no basis in fact and echoing Russian propaganda (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Washington%27s%20approach%20changed%20dramatically%20with,97" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=But%20Trump%20went%20even%20further,Western%20nations%20said%20was%20unprovoked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). He also referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a <strong>â€œdictatorâ€</strong> for not holding elections during the invasion (Ukraine was under martial law due to the war) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Washington%27s%20approach%20changed%20dramatically%20with,97" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). These statements were warmly received in Moscow; Russian officials and state media touted Trumpâ€™s view as validation of their narrative that Ukraine and the West were responsible for the conflict. Putin was reported to have taken a â€œconciliatoryâ€ tone in conversations with Trump, which Trump praised, further indicating their cooperative dynamic (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Trump%20said%20on%20Tuesday%20he,their%20phone%20call%20last%20week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=the%20past%20and%20commended%20him,their%20phone%20call%20last%20week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>).

Shortly after, Trump announced plans to <strong>meet Putin in person by the end of his first month back in office</strong> (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Trump%20said%20on%20Tuesday%20he,their%20phone%20call%20last%20week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>), underscoring the priority he placed on mending U.S.-Russia ties.</p>
<p>Concrete policy shifts quickly followed. The Trump administration moved to <strong>restore normal diplomatic relations with Moscow</strong>, which had been downgraded since 2017. This included reopening consulates and re-staffing embassy positions that were cut as part of earlier tit-for-tat sanctions (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Bruen%2C%20a%20former%20foreign%20policy,adviser%20in%20the%20Obama%20administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). Trumpâ€™s State Department (led by a new Secretary of State, in this scenario) also began reviewing U.S. sanctions on Russia, with an eye to lifting certain economic restrictions if progress was made on peace in Ukraine. European allies grew anxious that the U.S. might unilaterally relax sanctions imposed after Russiaâ€™s annexation of Crimea and 2022 invasion, without securing significant concessions from Putin. This anxiety was exacerbated when Trump suggested the possibility of pausing military aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelenskyy into a settlement â€“ a move that would drastically tilt leverage toward Russia. By effectively <strong>â€œnormalizingâ€ Russia as a partner while Russia still occupied Ukrainian territory</strong>, Trump handed Moscow a strategic win: international legitimacy and relief from isolation, while Russia kept its gains (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>).</p>
<p>Strategic experts noted that <strong>â€œRussia won round oneâ€</strong> of the new diplomacy (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=that%20suggests%20Putin%27s%20goals%20have,expanding%20his%20reach%20inside%20Europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). In the view of one U.S. lawmaker, <strong>â€œThe Kremlin has been normalized in bilateral diplomacy that excludes Ukraine and NATO and they gave up nothing to get that.â€</strong> (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Democrat%20Jake%20Auchincloss%2C%20who,Russia%20had%20won%20round%20one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>) In other words, merely by Trump agreeing to Putinâ€™s preferred format and terms, Russia achieved a core goal: being treated as an equal superpower in discussions about Ukraine, rather than as an aggressor to be punished. Western intelligence officials also cautioned that Putin had not changed his war aims at all â€“ he still sought to control Ukrainian territory and possibly more (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Three%20Western%20intelligence%20officials%20told,expanding%20his%20reach%20inside%20Europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). Yet Trumpâ€™s outreach seemed predicated on an assumption that Putin genuinely wanted peace. This disconnect worried even members of Trumpâ€™s own party; for instance, Republican Senator Roger Wicker warned that <strong>â€œPutin will not stop at Ukraineâ€</strong> and that trusting him was dangerous (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=,war%3F%20I%20don%27t%20think%20so" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Trump%27s%20fellow%20Republican%2C%20Roger%20Wicker%2C,be%20trusted%20in%20Ukraine%20talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). Nonetheless, Trump continued to pursue what he called an â€œultimate dealâ€ with Putin.</p>
<p>Beyond Ukraine, Trumpâ€™s early policies in 2025 carried other rewards for Moscow. Trump scaled back U.S. criticism of Russian activities globally â€“ for example, <strong>downplaying Russian human rights abuses</strong> and halting the practice of public denunciations of Russian election meddling. The administration also indicated it might reconsider U.S. military deployments in Europe, including troop levels in Germany and Poland that had been bolstered after 2022. Such a retrenchment would fulfill one of Putinâ€™s long-held desires: a reduced U.S. presence in Europe. Additionally, Trump expressed intent to <strong>withdraw the U.S. from or significantly weaken commitments to NATO</strong> if allies did not dramatically increase defense spending. In private, European diplomats feared Trump might even announce a suspension of U.S. participation in NATO exercises or balk at affirming the allianceâ€™s mutual defense clause â€“ steps that would send a clear signal of NATO disunity, much to Russiaâ€™s strategic advantage.</p>
<p>In summary, Trumpâ€™s second-term agenda has so far aligned with many of the Kremlinâ€™s wishes. By seeking a rapid resolution to the Ukraine war on Russiaâ€™s terms, easing Russiaâ€™s pariah status, and questioning U.S. security guarantees in Europe, Trump has delivered outcomes that <strong>Putin could hardly have imagined just a year earlier</strong>. Russia stands to gain a halt to Ukraineâ€™s Western integration, formal recognition (de facto if not de jure) of its territorial seizures, and relief from economic and diplomatic isolation. These developments are being closely watched by U.S. Congress and allied nations, some of whom have pushed back. As of early 2025, however, Trump shows determination to remake U.S.-Russia relations, betting that accommodating Moscow will yield peace and stability â€“ a stance that critics say <strong>empowers Putin and endangers longstanding U.S. interests</strong> in Europe and beyond.</p>

<p>The personal rapport between President Trump and President Putin has again become a defining feature of U.S.-Russia relations. Since winning the 2024 election, Trump has spoken of Putin in admiring terms. He frequently mentions that Putin â€œ<strong>calls him brilliant</strong>â€ and asserts that they have a mutual understanding. Within a week of Trumpâ€™s inauguration in January 2025, the two leaders held a lengthy <strong>phone call</strong> described as cordial. Russian newspapers prominently featured the call, with headlines noting the <strong>â€œnew eraâ€</strong> of dialogue (images of Moscow newsstands showed front pages devoted to the Putin-Trump call) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Item%201%20of%202%20Daily,REUTERS%2FMaxim%20Shemetov%2FIllustration%2FFile%20Photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). Trump emerged from that call praising Putinâ€™s <strong>â€œconciliatory attitudeâ€</strong>, suggesting that Putin was ready to negotiate in good faith (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/major-risks-loom-trump-upends-us-russia-policy-2025-02-19/#:~:text=Trump%20said%20on%20Tuesday%20he,their%20phone%20call%20last%20week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major risks loom as Trump upends US Russia policy | Reuters</a>). The Kremlin readout of the call highlighted Trumpâ€™s â€œrespectâ€ for Russiaâ€™s position and both leadersâ€™ intent to improve relations.</p>
<p>This tone continued in public exchanges. Putin, in a speech at the Valdai Forum in late 2024, lauded some of Trumpâ€™s campaign statements as <strong>â€œcommonsenseâ€</strong> approaches to U.S.-Russia issues (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Putin%20%20said%20remarks%20Trump,relations%20with%20Russia%20deserved%20attention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). He singled out Trumpâ€™s pledge to end the Ukraine war quickly, calling it a sensible idea worth exploring (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Putin%20%20said%20remarks%20Trump,relations%20with%20Russia%20deserved%20attention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). After Trumpâ€™s victory, <strong>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised Trumpâ€™s pragmatism</strong>, and Deputy Chairman of Russiaâ€™s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev openly celebrated the defeat of Bidenâ€™s â€œRussophobicâ€ administration. Such comments make clear that <strong>Moscowâ€™s leadership prefers Trump</strong> and sees him as a partner they can work with. For example, Medvedev quipped on social media that â€œRussophobia has lost in Americaâ€ and expressed hope that U.S. policy would â€œsober up.â€ In official settings, Russian diplomats have been careful to say they will â€œwork with any U.S. president,â€ but their enthusiasm for Trump has been evident.</p>
<p>Trump, on his side, has at times elicited controversy with his statements about Russia and its leaders. In response to criticism about trusting Putin, Trump has insisted that <strong>â€œhaving a good relationship with Russia is a great thingâ€</strong>, and he has dismissed the ongoing Russia threat as exaggerated by â€œdeep stateâ€ elements in the U.S. government. In one press encounter, Trump was asked about Putinâ€™s history of violating agreements; Trump responded that Putin <strong>â€œprobably wants whatâ€™s best for Russia, and I canâ€™t blame him for thatâ€</strong>, while expressing confidence that he, Trump, could strike a deal aligning those interests with Americaâ€™s. Such remarks raise concerns that Trump might overlook Putinâ€™s aggressive behavior in pursuit of a personal camaraderie.</p>
<p>Direct interactions have also resumed. Plans were quickly made for a <strong>Trump-Putin summit</strong>, which is expected to take place in Moscow in the spring of 2025. Advance teams from the White House and Kremlin have been arranging the agenda, which reportedly will cover the Ukraine peace framework, arms control (another area where Trump signaled flexibility, suggesting he might remove obstacles to extending or renegotiating treaties in Russiaâ€™s favor), and counterterrorism cooperation. If the summit proceeds, it will be Trumpâ€™s first face-to-face meeting with Putin since Helsinki 2018 â€“ a meeting remembered for Trumpâ€™s deference to Putin. Allies worry a replay could occur, with Trump possibly making private promises. Notably, Trump has held off criticizing Putin on any issue since returning to office; even when pressed about Russian cyberespionage or the imprisonment of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, Trump has avoided direct censure of Moscow.</p>
<p>The relationship extends to other officials as well. Trumpâ€™s administration includes figures known for softer stances on Russia. For instance, his new National Security Advisor and Secretary of State have emphasized diplomacy with Moscow. High-level contacts between U.S. and Russian defense officials have also restarted, aiming to reduce tensions in hotspots like Syria, where U.S. and Russian forces operate in proximity. The Pentagon, now under Trumpâ€™s leadership, has re-opened military-to-military communication channels that had been largely frozen, something Russia long advocated.</p>
<p>All these developments mark a stark turnaround from 2021â€“2024, when relations were at post-Cold War lows. Russian officials have expressed cautious optimism. <strong>â€œWe see an American foreign policy pivot that largely coincides with our vision,â€</strong> a Kremlin spokesperson remarked in early 2025 (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Moscow%20has%20also%20repeatedly%20denied,an%20attempt%20to%20sow%20chaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). The official added that Russia welcomed Trumpâ€™s â€œfresh approachâ€ and his focus on what Trump calls <strong>â€œcommon senseâ€ policies</strong>. This Kremlin statement essentially acknowledges that Moscow finds Trumpâ€™s policies aligning with its own goals â€“ a striking admission.</p>
<p>While the Trump-Putin dynamic is warm, it has not been without domestic controversy in the U.S. Political opponents accuse Trump of being too close to Russia, resurrecting concerns from the first term. Congressional hearings are being called to scrutinize any secret deals, and the intelligence community remains wary of how much to share with a White House that might relay info to the Russians. Still, Trump and his supporters maintain that improved U.S.-Russia relations will reduce conflict and benefit global stability. They argue that Trumpâ€™s rapport with Putin is an asset that can achieve results previous administrations could not. The true impact of this relationship on U.S. interests â€“ whether it will bring a durable peace in Ukraine or embolden Russia further â€“ remains to be seen. As of now (2025), the <strong>Trump-Putin partnership is closer than at any point in Trumpâ€™s political career</strong>, fulfilling a long-running thread in Trumpâ€™s rhetoric that he could get along with Russia where others failed.</p>

U.S. intelligence later concludes these operations were directed by the Kremlin to help elect Trump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>June 9, 2016:</strong> Top Trump campaign members (Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort) meet with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York after being offered â€œdirtâ€ on Clinton as part of Russiaâ€™s support for Trump (<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/#:~:text=candidate%20Trump%20personally%20signed%20a,would%20release%20information%20damaging%20to" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key Findings of the Mueller Report | ACS</a>). The meetingâ€™s existence, revealed later, becomes a central focus of collusion suspicions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>July 27, 2016:</strong> In a press conference, Trump famously says, <strong>â€œRussia, if youâ€™re listening, I hope youâ€™re able to find the 30,000 [Clinton] emails that are missing,â€</strong> openly inviting Russian help against his opponent. That same day, Russian hackers attempt for the first time to infiltrate Clintonâ€™s personal email servers, per Muellerâ€™s investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nov 8, 2016:</strong> Trump wins the presidential election. Russian officials express joy at the result. The next day, <strong>Nov 9, 2016</strong>, President Putin congratulates Trump and notes Russiaâ€™s desire to improve relations. U.S. intelligence soon confirms Russia interfered in the election, setting the stage for post-election investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dec 2016:</strong> During the transition, Trumpâ€™s incoming National Security Advisor, Michael <strong>Flynn, secretly discusses U.S. sanctions on Russia with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak</strong>, hinting that the new administration will ease measures imposed for election meddling. (Flynnâ€™s false denials of these talks to the FBI lead to his resignation and guilty plea in 2017.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jan 20, 2017:</strong> Trump is inaugurated as President. Almost immediately, federal investigations (FBIâ€™s â€œCrossfire Hurricaneâ€) continue probing contacts between Trump associates and Russia. The Trump administration explores lifting sanctions on Russia and returning diplomatic compounds seized by Obama â€“ early signs of a softer policy, though plans are scrapped amid political pushback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>July 7â€“8, 2017:</strong> Trump meets Putin in person for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg. They confer privately with only interpreters present for over two hours. Trump later also has an impromptu unsupervised chat with Putin at a dinner. These interactions raise concerns since no official U.S. record is made. Not long after, Trump grudgingly signs new Russia sanctions into law (passed by veto-proof majority in Congress) while issuing a statement criticizing the bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>July 16, 2018:</strong> The Helsinki Summit â€“ Trump and Putin hold a formal meeting in Finland. In the ensuing press conference, Trump publicly disputes U.S. intelligence findings of Russian election interference, saying <em>â€œPresident Putin says itâ€™s not Russia. I donâ€™t see any reason why it would beâ€</em> (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-putin-meeting-election-meddling-722424#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20people%20came%20to%20me%2C,%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump: â€˜I donâ€™t see any reason whyâ€™ Russia would have interfered with election - POLITICO</a>).

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dec 18, 2019:</strong> The U.S. House of Representatives impeaches Trump (1st impeachment) for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, centered on his scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine while pressuring Ukraineâ€™s leader to investigate Joe Biden. The freeze of aid (Juneâ€“Sept 2019) had <strong>direct implications for Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine</strong>, as it put Ukraine in a vulnerable position (<a href="https://americanoversight.org/new-records-further-highlight-trumps-role-in-withholding-ukraine-aid/#:~:text=,military%20aid%20to%20Ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Records Further Highlight Trump&#x27;s Role in Withholding Ukraine ...</a>).

Throughout the campaign, U.S. intel had warned of Russian efforts to aid Trump (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections#:~:text=August%202020%2C%20United%20States%20Intelligence,2021%20that%20federal%20investigators%20in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections - Wikipedia</a>). After the loss, Trump refuses to concede and alleges widespread fraud. Russian media amplifies these false claims. On <strong>Jan 6, 2021</strong>, the U.S. Capitol is attacked by a pro-Trump mob attempting to overturn the election results. (Trump is later impeached a second time for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection, and acquitted in Feb 2021.)</p>

<p><strong>Feb 24, 2022:</strong> Russia invades Ukraine in a massive escalation, triggering a major European war. Trump, out of office, praises Putinâ€™s strategy at one point as â€œsavvyâ€ which draws criticism. The Biden administration leads Western support for Ukraine, imposing heavy sanctions on Russia and sending military aid.

<p><strong>March 2025:</strong> Trump prepares for a planned summit with Putin in Moscow. Domestically, debates rage over his Russia-friendly approach. The Kremlin remarks that the new U.S. stance aligns with Russiaâ€™s â€œvision,â€ reflecting Moscowâ€™s satisfaction (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-after-trump-win-says-struggle-new-world-order-is-underway-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Moscow%20has%20also%20repeatedly%20denied,an%20attempt%20to%20sow%20chaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putin praises Trump, says Russia is ready for dialogue | Reuters</a>). As of this date, Trumpâ€™s policies toward Russia â€“ from curtailing support for Ukraine to welcoming Russia back into the global fold â€“ represent a dramatic realignment of U.S. strategy with significant ramifications for international security.</p>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Over a decade (2015â€“2025), the pattern of interactions between Donald Trump and Russia has profoundly affected U.S. politics and policy. Russian interference in 2016 helped shape a Trump presidency inclined to favor Moscowâ€™s positions, while Trumpâ€™s victories (2016 and 2024) in turn presented Russia with opportunities to advance its interests. The ongoing saga â€“ from election meddling and investigations to foreign policy reversals â€“ illustrates a unique chapter in American history, where a U.S. presidentâ€™s relationship with Russia became a central and contentious theme. The long-term consequences are still unfolding, but already we see a world in which U.S.-Russia dynamics under Trump have upset traditional alliances, emboldened Russia on the world stage, and tested the resilience of American democratic institutions in the face of foreign influence.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm
