The document should be detailed and comprehensive. Do not include summaries or reference other works; present the entire idea.

# Introduction

Describe the entity's mission, including its historical and traditional roles prior to any recent administrative changes. Detail the beneficial work they perform in the US and abroad, explaining how these activities benefit taxpayers. Provide a comprehensive list of all their past actions and programs.

The main section of the document will be a section for each individual action taken by that department under the new administration. Trump is currently in his second term as president.

Research using the internet every decision, action, budget cut, program cut, or layoff that has occurred under this department during the new Trump administration, including those related to "doge". Research any news related to the department, and break them down into topics.

The final report should include at least one section for every bureau or office under the main entity. The actions taken thus far should be attributed to each individual office or bureau of the department.

Write about each change in the department with a critical eye.

What is the change, and what is the administration's claim as to why?
What this change really does, what harm it causes, and how that fits into Trump's larger, more nefarious plan of advancing fascism and kleptocracy.

Each change should be researched and given its own section under the bureau or office.

If the department as a whole, or the department head, did something outside of its sub-bureaus, include that in a section as well.
