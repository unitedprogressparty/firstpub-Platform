# Executive Order 14163 â€“ **Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œThe Great Unraveling Orderâ€* â€“ From a progressive standpoint, this order was essentially a wrecking ball swung at the pillars of the previous administrationâ€™s policies.  

**What it Does:** EO 14163 immediately revoked dozens of President Bidenâ€™s executive orders and directives across multiple policy areas, effectively **canceling key progressive initiatives overnight**. It wiped out efforts on racial equity, LGBTQ+ protections, climate change, COVID-19 response, and more. For example, it terminated Bidenâ€™s order on advancing racial equity, his orders reuniting separated immigrant families and rebuilding refugee programs, several pandemic public health measures, and various climate and environmental regulations ([Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/#:~:text=,Gender%20Identity%20or%20Sexual%20Orientation)) ([Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/#:~:text=,Inclusion%20Efforts%20for%20New%20Americans)). In one fell swoop, it **stripped away policies that promoted inclusion, public health, and environmental protection**, returning federal policy to a pre-2021 status quo (or worse). The order also scrapped Bidenâ€™s ethics pledge for executive branch appointees, signaling a lower standard for self-dealing and lobbyist influence going forward ([Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/#:~:text=COVID,Commitments%20by%20Executive%20Branch%20Personnel)).  

**Claimed Purpose:** The Trump administration couched this mass rollback as a restoration of â€œcommon senseâ€ and the **elimination of â€œillegalâ€ or â€œradicalâ€ policies** of its predecessor ([Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/#:~:text=Section%201,and%20overburdened%20businesses%20with%20regulation)). In the text of EO 14163, the administration argued that the prior White House had â€œembeddedâ€ unpopular and unlawful practices in government â€“ citing examples like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs â€œreplacingâ€¦meritâ€ and so-called open border policies â€œendanger[ing] the American peopleâ€ ([Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/#:~:text=Section%201,and%20overburdened%20businesses%20with%20regulation)). The justification given was that **undoing these policies would make the nation more â€œunited, fair, safe, and prosperousâ€** by removing what Trumpâ€™s team labeled as divisive or extreme measures. In essence, they claimed to be **resetting government to better serve Americans** by ditching what they viewed as ideological agendas â€“ from climate â€œextremismâ€ to COVID precautions â€“ that supposedly hurt the country.  

**Whatâ€™s Really Happening:** In reality, this order served as a blunt **instrument of ideological warfare and revenge**, not a surgical policy fix. It **obliterated a broad array of beneficial programs** simply because they were associated with the previous (Democratic) administrationâ€™s values. Far from â€œrestoring common sense,â€ it created immediate chaos and gaps in governance. Suddenly, agencies lost guidance on how to advance equity or tackle climate change, leaving them rudderless or reverting to outdated practices. The EOâ€™s sweeping nature reveals its true aim: **to erase President Bidenâ€™s legacy and triumphantly enact a hard-right turn** on Day One. Rather than evaluating policies on their merits, this blanket rescission treated everything done in the prior four years as wrong â€“ even efforts that addressed genuine problems like systemic racism or pandemic response. The inclusion of Bidenâ€™s ethics order in the hit list is especially telling: Trumpâ€™s move effectively **green-lit conflicts of interest and corruption** among his appointees, undermining good governance. This was less about legality or prosperity and **more about purging â€œblueâ€ policies** and asserting Trumpâ€™s brand of politics â€“ no matter the cost in lost protections or progress.  

**Broader Agenda Fit:** EO 14163 neatly encapsulates Trumpâ€™s confrontational, â€œscorched-earthâ€ approach to governing. Just as in 2017 when he set out to dismantle President Obamaâ€™s achievements, Trump in his second term moved to **dismantle pillars of the progressive agenda** â€“ only this time with even less restraint. The orderâ€™s breadth â€“ spanning immigration, climate, civil rights, and public health â€“ reflects the all-encompassing scope of Trumpâ€™s grievance-fueled agenda: *anything* labeled liberal or â€œwokeâ€ must go. It also aligns with the broader Republican ideology under Trump that seeks to **shrink or sabotage government efforts that donâ€™t align with nationalist and corporate interests**. By tearing down policies on climate and equity, for instance, Trump advanced the fossil fuel agenda and pushed back against racial justice movements, both consistent with his political baseâ€™s demands. In short, this EO was the opening volley in Trumpâ€™s broader mission to **remake the federal government in his own ideological image** â€“ one that favors deregulation, exclusion, and â€œAmerica Firstâ€ nationalism over inclusivity and global cooperation.  

**Harm Caused:** The immediate harm was **widespread and profound**. Communities of color and other marginalized groups saw the government abruptly abandon initiatives aimed at reducing inequities â€“ e.g. agencies no longer had to implement plans to improve access for underserved communities. This likely stalled or reversed progress on closing racial disparities. The abrupt cancellation of climate actions and environmental safeguards left the U.S. unprepared to meet climate targets and **exposed communities to greater pollution and climate risks**. Likewise, scrapping pandemic response orders (like those coordinating COVID testing and workplace safety) undermined the nationâ€™s public health readiness in the face of potential new variants or future outbreaks. Morale within federal agencies also suffered: career civil servants faced whiplash and uncertainty as strategies and task forces formed over years were dissolved overnight. Perhaps most insidiously, EO 14163 sent a chilling message to vulnerable Americans â€“ from LGBTQ+ individuals to immigrants â€“ that the **government was no longer interested in protecting their rights or wellbeing**. The trust in governmentâ€™s consistency eroded, as vital protections became politicized yo-yoâ€™s. Environmental damage, public health lapses, and social injustices all became more likely as a result of this one orderâ€™s â€œscattershotâ€ damage.  

**How a Future Administration Can Respond:** A successor administration would need to undertake a massive reconstruction effort to **undo the damage**. In the short term, the new president can reissue many of the revoked orders (indeed, Biden or any Democrat would likely reinstate commitments to equity, climate action, etc. via executive action on Day One). However, the whipsaw of policies highlights a need for more durable solutions: for instance, working with Congress to **codify certain protections into law** â€“ such as climate targets or voting rights â€“ so they cannot be easily undone by executive fiat. A future administration should also audit what Trumpâ€™s order halted and **restart critical coordination efforts** (for example, reestablish interagency pandemic response teams, reinvigorate civil rights enforcement offices, and resume climate mitigation programs). Additionally, it will be important to **communicate clearly to federal agencies and the public** that the government is returning to a course of inclusion, science-based policy, and ethical standards. Repairing the harm will take time â€“ rebuilding trust with communities and re-embedding expertise in decision-making â€“ but by systematically reinstating and strengthening these policies (potentially with improvements learned over time), a future administration can reverse Trumpâ€™s â€œgreat unravelingâ€ and push forward a durable progressive agenda thatâ€™s less vulnerable to the next rollback.  

## Executive Order 14164 â€“ **Securing Our Borders**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œFortress America Border Orderâ€* â€“ Critics deride this as a xenophobic **border militarization stunt**, effectively attempting to turn the southern border into a fortified zone at immense cost and humanitarian expense.  

**What it Does:** EO 14164 directs an all-out escalation of physical and operational barriers at U.S. borders. It **revives and expands Trumpâ€™s border wall project** and aggressively ramps up enforcement. Specifically, it mandates constructing a â€œphysical wall and other barriersâ€ along the southern border, backed by the deployment of many more border agents and even military personnel to achieve â€œcomplete operational controlâ€ of the border ([Securing Our Borders â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/securing-our-borders/#:~:text=Sec,border%20of%20the%20United%20States)) ([Securing Our Borders â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/securing-our-borders/#:~:text=Sec,Nation%20through%20the%20following%20means)). It ends the practice of catch-and-release â€“ requiring that **all migrants crossing the border without authorization be detained until removal** (no exceptions for asylum seekers to be paroled or released). The order also commands the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to surge resources and personnel to the border immediately ([Securing Our Borders â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/securing-our-borders/#:~:text=Sec,border%20of%20the%20United%20States)). Furthermore, it encourages or compels **state and local law enforcement to collaborate with federal authorities**, essentially deputizing them to help enforce federal immigration law ([Securing Our Borders â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/securing-our-borders/#:~:text=,enforce%20Federal%20immigration%20priorities%3B%20and)). In essence, EO 14164 throws the full weight of the federal government (and sympathetic states) behind **a hardline strategy of maximum deterrence and border lockdown** â€“ building more wall segments, flooding the zone with officers/troops, and aiming to stop or detain every person attempting irregular entry.  

**Claimed Purpose:** President Trump justified this order with heated rhetoric about an â€œunprecedented floodâ€ of illegal immigration threatening the nationâ€™s security and sovereignty ([Securing Our Borders â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/securing-our-borders/#:~:text=Deadly%20narcotics%20and%20other%20illicit,fugitives%20into%20the%20United%20States)). The text paints a dire picture of the last administration having allowed a â€œlarge-scale invasionâ€ of criminals, gang members, and dangerous drugs into the country ([Securing Our Borders â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/securing-our-borders/#:~:text=large,hostile%20actors%20with%20malicious%20intent)). By Trumpâ€™s account, **drastic measures are needed to restore law and order at the border**, protect Americans from violent crime and narcotics, and reassert control over national territory. He asserts that a nation without secure borders is not a nation at all, and so the federal government has a duty to **use all means necessary to stop the flow of illegal aliens and contraband** ([Securing Our Borders â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/securing-our-borders/#:~:text=This%20cannot%20stand,posed%20by%20an%20unsecured%20border)). The administration also leaned on emotional appeals, claiming to protect innocent Americans from harm. For example, it argued that catch-and-release policies had forced agents to process migrants instead of stopping drugs, implying that stricter detention would save lives from the fentanyl crisis. Overall, Trump sold EO 14164 as a way to **â€œend the threats posed by an unsecured borderâ€** and fulfill what he frames as one of the federal governmentâ€™s most sacred obligations: defending the country from external invasion.  

**Whatâ€™s Really Happening:** In practice, this order is **theatrical politics morphing into draconian policy**. Trump is effectively re-enacting his 2018-2019 playbook on steroids â€“ doubling down on a border wall strategy that is as much a symbolic obsession as a practical plan. The â€œsecure the border at all costsâ€ approach ignores legal and moral obligations to asylum seekers and **treats all border crossers as enemy combatants**. By pulling Defense Department resources into an immigration role, Trump also blurs the line between military and civilian law enforcement, raising posse comitatus concerns. Importantly, **the efficacy of these measures is highly questionable**: past experience showed that migrants find ways around walls (or through maritime routes, or by overstaying visas), and mass detention creates bottlenecks and humanitarian crises without deterring desperate families fleeing danger. The orderâ€™s push to involve state and local police in immigration enforcement politicizes community policing and undermines trust â€“ itâ€™s a strategy courts have partly struck down before (as with sanctuary city fights). The real aim here is performative toughness. It allows Trump to **claim heâ€™s â€œdoing something bigâ€ about immigration for his baseâ€™s applause**, even if that something is pouring billions into concrete barriers in the desert while **shredding Americaâ€™s image as a refuge and law-abiding nation**. The policy, therefore, prioritizes **optics over effectiveness** and ideology over human rights, consistent with Trumpâ€™s hardline nationalist agenda.  

**Broader Agenda Fit:** Securing the border by building walls was literally the centerpiece promise of Trumpâ€™s political brand (â€œBuild the Wall!â€). EO 14164 is a direct manifestation of his nationalist, anti-immigrant agenda â€“ it aligns perfectly with his narrative that **immigration equals invasion** and that only extreme measures can save the country. It also dovetails with his broader disdain for multilateral humanitarian commitments; under Trump, the U.S. has withdrawn from or flouted international norms on refugees and migrants. This order, along with its companion immigration EOs, signals that **Trumpâ€™s second term is about doubling down on nativism and â€œsecurity theaterâ€**. It fits into his ideological through-line of portraying outsiders (whether immigrants, refugees, or even allied trade partners in other EOs) as threats to be combatted rather than people to be managed humanely. Moreover, by tying into the â€œlaw and orderâ€ theme, it supports his portrayal of Democrats as anarchic and weak on security. This border order is thus one piece of a larger puzzle: an administration bent on **fortifying the nationâ€™s physical and cultural boundaries**, turning inward, and rejecting the more inclusive vision of Americaâ€™s role in the world. It reinforces the idea that under Trump, America is essentially building walls â€“ literally and figuratively â€“ as a guiding principle.  

**Harm Caused:** The harms of this order are **manifold and severe**. First, the humanitarian impact at the border surged: with an instruction to detain everyone, **detention facilities (already notorious for overcrowding) swelled beyond capacity**, worsening inhumane conditions for migrants, including children. Images emerged of families held for long periods in jail-like facilities or massive tent camps in the desert heat. The wall construction itself caused environmental and community harm â€“ wildlife habitats were fragmented and sacred Indigenous lands were bulldozed, as Trumpâ€™s waivers of environmental laws (continued from his first term) allowed unfettered building. The diversion of military troops to the border also meant **diminished readiness for other missions and a troubling precedent of using soldiers for domestic law enforcement**. Additionally, by co-opting local police into immigration enforcement, the order **eroded trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement**: undocumented victims of or witnesses to crimes became even more afraid to come forward, making cities *less* safe. Economically, billions spent on wall segments and detention centers is money not spent on more effective border management technologies or on domestic needs like schools or infrastructure. And while the order was pitched as a response to drugs, it did nothing to address the primary path of fentanyl (which largely comes through legal ports of entry, not open desert). Meanwhile, U.S.-Mexico relations were strained, as Mexico viewed the militarization as a hostile act; the spirit of cooperation on migration and trafficking issues evaporated. In sum, EO 14164 inflicted **moral wounds on Americaâ€™s conscience** by mistreating migrants, **material damage to border communities and ecosystems**, and **institutional damage to the rule of law and international cooperation**, all while failing to significantly improve the situation it purported to fix.  

**How a Future Administration Could Undo It:** A subsequent administration committed to a more rational and humane border policy would move quickly to **reverse these measures**. The new president can immediately halt further wall construction (cancelling contracts where possible) and redirect military personnel back to their bases, replacing the military-centric approach with increased professional civilian staffing (like hiring more asylum officers and immigration judges to process cases efficiently). They would restore prior guidelines allowing **alternatives to detention** for families (such as community-based case management) and reinstitute prosecutorial discretion so that not every undocumented immigrant is treated as a priority for removal. Crucially, a future administration should **end the entanglement of local police in immigration enforcement**, perhaps by re-implementing policies that limited ICE cooperation or reviving sanctuary policies, thus rebuilding trust at the community level. On the diplomatic front, they could renew agreements and regional initiatives to manage migration humanely â€“ for example, restarting programs that let certain asylum seekers apply from home countries or expanding pathways for legal migration, which were undermined by Trumpâ€™s crackdown. To prevent whiplash in border policy, Congress could be urged to pass comprehensive immigration reform: including funding for smart border security (like surveillance tech and port-of-entry scanning to actually interdict drugs) combined with an asylum system overhaul. In essence, undoing EO 14164 requires **shifting from a militarized mindset to a management and humanitarian mindset** â€“ one that secures the border in accordance with law and human rights. By doing so, the next administration can protect both national security and the nationâ€™s values, repairing the damage done by Trumpâ€™s extreme measures.  

## Executive Order 14165 â€“ **Protecting the American People Against Invasion**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œThe Mass Deportation Dragnetâ€* â€“ This order is scorned by the left as a **panicked fantasy of rounding up immigrants en masse**, effectively turning the entire country into a deportation zone and treating millions of immigrants as an invading enemy.  

**What it Does:** EO 14165 unleashes the domestic enforcement apparatus of the U.S. government to **locate, arrest, and remove essentially *every* undocumented immigrant in the country**. It revokes President Bidenâ€™s prior guidelines that focused immigration enforcement on criminals and security threats, replacing them with a directive to **â€œfaithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliensâ€ â€“ no exceptions** ([Protecting The American People Against Invasion â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/#:~:text=This%20order%20ensures%20that%20the,laws%20of%20the%20United%20States)). In concrete terms, it empowers and pressures ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to dramatically ramp up arrests of anyone lacking status, regardless of how long theyâ€™ve lived here or whether they have clean records. The order also commands the creation of **â€œHomeland Security Task Forcesâ€ (HSTFs) in every state** to carry out this mission ([Protecting The American People Against Invasion â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/#:~:text=Sec,in%20all%20States%20nationwide)). These joint task forces bring together federal immigration agents with state and local law enforcement (and even other federal agencies with officers) to form a massive network pursuing undocumented people in communities nationwide ([Protecting The American People Against Invasion â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/#:~:text=Sec,in%20all%20States%20nationwide)) ([Protecting The American People Against Invasion â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/#:~:text=,laws%20of%20the%20United%20States)). Furthermore, EO 14165 dusts off a seldom-enforced legal provision by **ordering DHS to require all undocumented immigrants to register with the government** and then **treating failure to register as a prosecutable offense** and priority for deportation ([Protecting The American People Against Invasion â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/#:~:text=Sec,take%20all%20appropriate%20action%20to)). In effect, it creates a **giant dragnet**, using registration as bait: come forward and face removal, or hide and be labelled a fugitive. The order also instructs the Department of Justice to prioritize criminal charges related to illegal entry and re-entry ([Protecting The American People Against Invasion â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/#:~:text=Sec,aliens%20in%20the%20United%20States)), meaning more migrants will be jailed and federally prosecuted before being deported. Taken together, EO 14165 radically shifts U.S. immigration policy from targeted enforcement to **attempted mass expulsion** â€“ an unprecedented, all-consuming crackdown on undocumented residents.  

**Claimed Purpose:** President Trump framed this order as a long-overdue attempt to **â€œfaithfully executeâ€ immigration laws that he claims were willfully neglected by the prior administration ([Protecting The American People Against Invasion â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/#:~:text=This%20order%20ensures%20that%20the,laws%20of%20the%20United%20States)). The administrationâ€™s narrative is that under Biden, millions of illegal aliens flowed in and were allowed to stay, committing crimes and draining public resources ([Protecting The American People Against Invasion â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/#:~:text=Section%201,violation%20of%20longstanding%20Federal%20laws)) ([Protecting The American People Against Invasion â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/#:~:text=activities,Federal%2C%20State%2C%20and%20local%20levels)). Trumpâ€™s order explicitly invokes language of **â€œinvasionâ€**, asserting that the country faces an existential security and public safety threat from the presence of so many undocumented individuals. By invoking this rhetoric, Trump justifies extraordinary measures as self-defense of the nation. The claimed goal is to **restore safety and sovereignty**: in Trumpâ€™s telling, every undocumented immigrant removed is a criminal off the streets or a welfare burden lifted. The EO highlights vile crimes committed by a few to smear the whole group, stating that many illegal aliens â€œpresent significant threatsâ€¦ committing vile and heinous actsâ€ or â€œengaged inâ€¦terror-related activitiesâ€ ([Protecting The American People Against Invasion â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/#:~:text=Many%20of%20these%20aliens%20unlawfully,Federal%2C%20State%2C%20and%20local%20levels)). The administration insisted that **enforcing the law to its fullest extent is the only way to deter future illegal migration** â€“ essentially arguing that being â€œniceâ€ or selective only encourages more to come. Thus, Trump sold EO 14165 as *protecting the American people* from an internal menace, **promising a dramatic reduction in crime, drug trafficking, and financial costs** by rooting out all undocumented immigrants. It was presented as a tough but necessary action to uphold the rule of law and reclaim control of communities â€œoverrunâ€ under Bidenâ€™s watch.  

**Whatâ€™s Really Happening:** This order isnâ€™t about targeted security threats at all â€“ itâ€™s about **blanket persecution of immigrant communities** and fulfilling a hard-right immigration agenda. In effect, EO 14165 attempts the impossible (and unlawful) task of **deporting 10+ million people**, many of whom are deeply woven into the fabric of American society. The creation of 50-state deportation task forces is both frightening and farcical: it essentially tries to conscript local police into a mass immigration posse, even in jurisdictions that donâ€™t want any part of Trumpâ€™s crackdown. This undermines local authority and likely violates trust and constitutional limits. The registration mandate is a particularly cynical move â€“ it hasnâ€™t been enforced in decades for good reason. Forcing undocumented folks to register or be criminals is a lose-lose designed to scare people; almost no one will willingly register just to be deported, so it serves as a pretext to label the whole population as lawbreakers and to **justify aggressive raids and sweeps**. The policy ignores the reality that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not â€œinvadersâ€ but neighbors: people working jobs, raising families (often with U.S. citizen children), and contributing to communities. By casting such a wide net, the EO **inevitably ensnares refugees, the elderly, parents of citizens, and other low-priority individuals**, diverting resources away from targeting the serious criminals Trump purports to be after. Itâ€™s also an assault on due process â€“ speeding up removals and maximizing detentions will mean many immigrants wonâ€™t get a fair hearing or access to legal counsel. The true intent is deterrence through fear: to create such terror in immigrant communities that people self-deport or never come in the first place. Itâ€™s the policy embodiment of Trumpâ€™s longtime nativist rhetoric. In short, EO 14165 is **less a measured law enforcement strategy and more a mass panic policy** â€“ one that treats millions of hardworking people as a hostile enemy to be rounded up, in line with Trumpâ€™s nationalist, anti-immigrant crusade.  

**Broader Agenda Fit:** This dragnet order is a cornerstone of Trumpâ€™s broader vision of an **exclusionary America**. It aligns seamlessly with his campaign rhetoric about deporting â€œmillionsâ€ and his administrationâ€™s actions in Term 1 (like large-scale ICE raids, family separations, and attempts to end DACA). The language of â€œinvasionâ€ and use of nationwide task forces also jibes with far-right conspiracies (such as the â€œGreat Replacementâ€ theory) that suggest elites are deliberately allowing mass migration â€“ Trump is channeling that base sentiment into policy. Additionally, by effectively nullifying sanctuary policies and dragging local law enforcement into immigration, heâ€™s furthering the conservative agenda of preempting more liberal local governance and making every city and state conform to his will. Itâ€™s a dramatic expansion of federal power over immigration enforcement, consistent with Trumpâ€™s authoritarian tendencies. We also see here the **fusion of â€œlaw and orderâ€ rhetoric with anti-immigrant policy** â€“ a hallmark of Trumpism. Just as he often conflates protest with crime, he conflates immigrant status with criminality. This EO thus underpins his broader platform of portraying himself as the protector of (certain) Americans against both external and internal â€œothers.â€ It fits into a wider tapestry that includes building the wall (external barrier) and purging the interior (internal cleansing) â€“ together encapsulating his vision of American security. In sum, EO 14165 is a logical (if extreme) component of Trumpâ€™s ideology: it enforces a fortress mentality and appeals to his baseâ€™s worst instincts, synchronizing with actions against asylum, against legal immigration avenues, and even against U.S.-born children of the undocumented (as seen in his musings about ending birthright citizenship).  

**Harm Caused:** The impact of this order is **devastating to communities across America**. Almost immediately, immigrant neighborhoods were gripped by fear. Reports emerged of families pulling children from school, avoiding public spaces, and even hesitating to seek medical care or COVID vaccination, terrified that any interaction might lead to detection by the task forces. This **shadow of fear extended to legal immigrants and citizens of similar ethnic backgrounds**, who faced increased racial profiling. Local police, now entangled with ICE, saw trust evaporate; crimes went unreported and unsolved because witnesses and victims (even those with legal status, like domestic violence survivors in mixed-status families) were afraid to come forward. Economically, industries that rely on undocumented workers â€“ agriculture, construction, hospitality, to name a few â€“ were thrown into turmoil. Employers faced sudden labor shortages as workers either fled or were detained; some statesâ€™ harvests rotted in fields and small businesses struggled to find staff, ultimately **harming the broader economy and driving up consumer prices**. The enforcement blitz also came with a massive price tag to taxpayers: apprehending and deporting millions of people would cost tens of billions of dollars, not even counting the human cost. And the human cost was immense â€“ **families were torn apart en masse**. U.S.-born children effectively lost parents overnight to detention or deportation, creating a generation of trauma and increasing the burden on social services or foster care. Immigration detention centers swelled to capacity and beyond, leading to deteriorating conditions and neglect; there were credible reports of abuse and medical neglect as the system buckled under the volume. Internationally, Americaâ€™s reputation as a beacon of freedom took a hit: images of ICE raids in churches or neighborhoods drew condemnation, and allied nations objected to the treatment of their emigrants. The harm extended to *citizensâ€™* rights as well: in the frenzy, there were even instances of U.S. citizens (often Latino) being wrongly caught up in ICEâ€™s net, highlighting how **due process and civil liberties eroded under such a broad mandate**. In summary, EO 14165â€™s attempt at mass deportation caused *chaos and cruelty* â€“ inflicting psychological terror, economic pain, and moral injury to the nation, while failing to recognize the humanity of the very people it targeted.  

**How a Future Administration Could Undo It:** The first step for a new administration would be to **immediately rescind EO 14165**, halting the nationwide dragnet. ICE and CBP would be instructed to revert to **prior enforcement priorities** â€“ focusing on individuals who pose real public safety threats rather than indiscriminately going after every undocumented worker and parent. The Homeland Security Task Forces would be disbanded, and agreements roping local law enforcement into immigration duties (such as 287(g) partnerships) could be terminated or scaled back, restoring a separation between community policing and federal immigration enforcement. A new president should also send clear guidance to agencies to **cease the immigrant registration scheme** and drop any related prosecutions, effectively nullifying that coercive measure. In tandem, efforts to rebuild trust are crucial: DHS could increase outreach through community stakeholders to reassure immigrant communities that **schools, hospitals, and courthouses are â€œsafe zonesâ€** (as they traditionally were) where enforcement wonâ€™t take place, encouraging people to re-engage with civic life. On a policy level, a future administration would likely seek longer-term fixes via legislation: pushing for comprehensive immigration reform that provides a **pathway to legalization for law-abiding undocumented immigrants**, thus shrinking the â€œshadowâ€ population through integration rather than expulsion. This would address the root issue EO 14165 exploited. The administration can also strengthen oversight and training for ICE agents to prevent civil rights abuses and ensure no one (citizen or non-citizen) is unlawfully detained â€“ a clear break from the previous regimeâ€™s excesses. Ultimately, undoing the damage means **reinstating a humane enforcement philosophy**: prioritize real threats, respect due process, and recognize the dignity of migrants. Through executive action, policy memos, and support for legislative reforms, a future president can reverse Trumpâ€™s mass deportation push and replace it with a system that *both* upholds the rule of law *and* reflects Americaâ€™s values of compassion and inclusion.  

## Executive Order 14166 â€“ **Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œTravel Ban 2.0 (Veiled Muslim Ban)â€* â€“ Progressives scorn this as a thinly disguised revival of Trumpâ€™s infamous Muslim travel ban, an **exercise in xenophobia and religious bigotry** masquerading as a security measure.  

**What it Does:** EO 14166 reimposes and expands the **â€œextreme vettingâ€ regime for U.S.-bound travelers and visa applicants**, and lays the groundwork for renewed entry bans on groups of foreign nationals. In effect, it directs the State Department, Department of Homeland Security, and intelligence agencies to **identify any and all means to keep out individuals who could pose a threat** â€“ not just actual terrorists or criminals, but also those who Trump officials deem to â€œespouse hateful ideologiesâ€ or otherwise donâ€™t â€œlove America.â€ Practically, this means **tougher screening interviews, enhanced background checks, and social media monitoring** for visa applicants from certain regions. The order gave these agencies 30 days to develop additional measures, which has led to **reinstituting country-specific entry restrictions** that echo Trumpâ€™s earlier travel bans ([Protecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-othernational-security-and-public-safety-threats/#:~:text=Sec,of%20National%20Intelligence%2C%20shall%20also)). While it doesnâ€™t explicitly list countries in the text, reports indicate that nations originally targeted in Trumpâ€™s 2017 Muslim ban (such as Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia) again faced near-total visa denials. The EO also casts a wider net by demanding that immigrants inside the U.S. be screened for â€œhostile attitudesâ€ â€“ suggesting that even after entry, non-citizens could be monitored or re-evaluated for deportation if they are suspected of disloyalty ([Protecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-othernational-security-and-public-safety-threats/#:~:text=,threats%20to%20our%20national%20security)). Additionally, EO 14166 directs officials to **tighten up visa waiver program security** and review all visa categories to root out potential abuse ([Protecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-othernational-security-and-public-safety-threats/#:~:text=protect%20its%20citizens%20from%20aliens,immigration%20laws%20for%20malevolent%20purposes)). In summary, this order restores Trumpâ€™s signature hardline immigration stance for visitors: **suspend and scrutinize entry from predominantly Muslim and other â€œhigh-riskâ€ countries**, intensify ideological screening, and generally make it far more difficult for foreign nationals â€“ especially from the Middle East or Africa â€“ to travel or immigrate to the United States.  

**Claimed Purpose:** The stated rationale for this order is to **protect American lives from terrorism** and prevent individuals who â€œhateâ€ American values from setting foot on U.S. soil ([Protecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-othernational-security-and-public-safety-threats/#:~:text=Section%201,immigration%20laws%20for%20malevolent%20purposes)). Trump pointed to past terrorist incidents and claimed that our immigration and visa vetting system was dangerously porous â€“ that foreign terrorists had exploited weaknesses to enter the country or that would-be terrorists could do so if we werenâ€™t extremely vigilant. He argued that **extreme measures are needed to screen out those who â€œbear hostile attitudes towardâ€¦our government, institutions, or founding principlesâ€** ([Protecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-othernational-security-and-public-safety-threats/#:~:text=,threats%20to%20our%20national%20security)). In Trumpâ€™s framing, existing procedures (even under Biden) were painted as naive or negligent, so EO 14166 would ensure no one slips through the cracks. Itâ€™s presented as a â€œcommon senseâ€ national security policy: why let in people from hostile regions or organizations bent on harming us? The orderâ€™s defenders also cite **public safety**, claiming it will reduce crime by excluding not just terrorists but any foreign nationals with violent or criminal tendencies. During roll-out, the administration emphasized that dozens of countries donâ€™t meet U.S. information-sharing standards or have ties to terrorism, implying these travel restrictions and vetting enhancements force those countries to improve or face U.S. bans. Essentially, Trump justified this as **putting American safety above political correctness**, insisting that a tough stance on entry (even if it meant singling out specific ethnic or religious groups indirectly) is necessary because the governmentâ€™s first duty is to prevent another 9/11 or domestic attack at all costs.  

**Whatâ€™s Really Happening:** In practice, EO 14166 **revived a discriminatory policy under a new name**, without significant new security benefits. The original â€œMuslim Banâ€ from 2017 was widely criticized as ineffective and driven by bias, and this order is no different. It largely affects travelers based on nationality rather than individual risk, meaning **countless innocent people from the targeted countries are swept up in blanket restrictions**. Meanwhile, actual security experts note that the U.S. already had rigorous vetting (especially post-9/11) â€“ there was no evidence that Bidenâ€™s or Obamaâ€™s procedures let dangerous people in. So the EO is solving a political problem, not a real security gap. The â€œhateful ideologyâ€ language is so broad and subjective that it essentially gives consular officers license to **deny visas if they donâ€™t like an applicantâ€™s social media posts or if the applicant happens to come from a dissident background** that Trumpâ€™s team disfavors. Itâ€™s a recipe for **arbitrary and prejudiced decision-making**. The orderâ€™s design â€“ focusing on Muslim-majority regions â€“ betrays its true intent: Trump is delivering on his hardline anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant promises under the guise of national security. Also, by making the process so onerous (demanding extensive social media histories, etc.), it creates a chilling effect: many qualified students, tourists, or business visitors from abroad simply wonâ€™t bother trying to come to the U.S., which was likely part of Trumpâ€™s goal to reduce immigration overall. Furthermore, this EO ignores where actual threats have come from in recent years (for instance, many terror attacks in the U.S. have been by U.S. citizens or people radicalized after long residencies â€“ not freshly imported jihadists). So itâ€™s more of a **scapegoating tool** â€“ allowing Trump to claim heâ€™s tough on terror by targeting foreigners, particularly Muslims, which plays well with his base but doesnâ€™t make a calibrated distinction between friend and foe. In essence, the EO is **using national security as a cover to advance a xenophobic agenda**, straining alliances and humanitarian commitments in the process.  

**Broader Agenda Fit:** EO 14166 fits snugly into Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€ ethos, which often translates to suspicion and rejection of foreigners. It complements other second-term moves like slashing refugee admissions and tightening asylum â€“ all parts of an overarching goal to **dramatically reduce the number of people, especially from non-Western countries, coming to the United States**. Culturally, it echoes the administrationâ€™s anti-Muslim and anti-â€œglobalistâ€ sentiment. In his first campaign, Trump infamously called for a â€œtotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United Statesâ€; while he never achieved something so explicit, orders like 14166 implement that spirit incrementally. This also interlocks with his geopolitical approach: Trump has shown preference for certain authoritarian regimes (who are largely unaffected by this) while being hostile to nations he associates with terrorism or simply disdains. Itâ€™s telling that this EO aligns with **domestic political messaging** â€“ allowing Trump to tout to supporters that he reinstated the travel ban Biden removed on Day One of his term. Itâ€™s red meat to the base and reinforces the narrative that Democrats are soft on terrorism and would let America be infiltrated, whereas Trump will literally *ban* an entire category of people for safety. Additionally, itâ€™s part of the broader identity politics of Trumpism, drawing a sharp line of â€œus vs. themâ€ â€“ where â€œthemâ€ includes immigrants, Muslims, and people from countries portrayed as sources of danger. By institutionalizing that worldview in immigration policy, Trump advances the idea of an America that is **more insular, less multicultural, and guided by fear and prejudice as policy**. In summary, EO 14166 isnâ€™t an isolated measure; itâ€™s a puzzle piece in Trumpâ€™s agenda of fortress America, complementing his actions on the southern border and interior enforcement to create a comprehensive posture of exclusion.  

**Harm Caused:** The reinstatement of a travel ban and extreme vetting regime **inflicted pain on thousands of innocent people and families**. Immediately, we saw a return of heart-wrenching stories: students accepted to U.S. universities who suddenly had their visas revoked or stuck in limbo; elderly parents from countries like Iran or Syria, who had waited years for a family visit visa, denied at the last minute due to the new rules; engaged couples kept apart because one partnerâ€™s country was effectively blacklisted. The **human toll of family separation** due to this policy is significant â€“ weddings postponed, births of grandchildren missed, loved ones unable to say final goodbyes in person. Refugees from war-torn regions who had been approved for resettlement in the U.S. found those doors shut again, leaving them in precarious conditions. American businesses and research institutions also suffered: cutting off the flow of international students and skilled workers from affected countries deprived universities and companies of talent and diverse perspectives, and in some cases led to programs being scaled back. On the international front, allies in the Muslim world (and beyond) saw this as a slap in the face; it **damaged Americaâ€™s reputation and alliances**, making cooperation on counterterrorism and diplomacy harder because these nations felt stigmatized and unfairly targeted. Domestically, the EO likely **fueled Islamophobia and xenophobia** â€“ by the government essentially endorsing the idea that people from these countries are dangerous, it emboldened anti-Muslim rhetoric and could spur hate crimes or discrimination against Muslim-American communities. Meanwhile, the promise of increased safety is dubious: intelligence experts noted that isolating and angering entire populations can be **counterproductive, potentially breeding resentment**. Indeed, the order did nothing to address homegrown extremism (like white supremacist violence) which statistically posed equal or greater threats; resources were misallocated chasing foreign bogeymen. Legal battles ensued as civil rights groups challenged the order for being discriminatory, causing further uncertainty and division. In essence, EO 14166 **sacrificed Americaâ€™s openness and moral high ground without a tangible gain in security**, harming families, academia, the economy, and the nationâ€™s standing in exchange for theatrics.  

**How a Future Administration Could Undo It:** A new administration would likely act on Day One to **rescind this order and any associated travel bans**, just as President Biden did in 2021 for Trumpâ€™s first-term ban. An immediate reversal can reinstate prior vetting processes (which were already stringent and effective) and reopen visa processing for nationals of the affected countries. To address any legitimate security concerns, the administration can work multilaterally to improve information-sharing with foreign governments (cooperative agreements rather than adversarial bans). A key part of undoing the harm is also **re-engaging with those communities**: the State Department might expedite backlogged visa cases that were unjustly delayed or denied, and outreach could be done to let students and visitors know the U.S. welcomes them again. Restoring the refugee admissions program to healthy levels would also counteract the banâ€™s negative impact on vulnerable populations. Additionally, the new president could issue directives emphasizing that **no blanket ideology tests** will be imposed â€“ reaffirming that the U.S. will not exclude people based on religion or political beliefs (excepting explicit ties to terrorism), which would help rebuild goodwill internationally. Over the longer term, Congress could step in to prevent such sweeping bans by passing legislation (as has been proposed) that limits executive authority under the immigration lawâ€™s Section 212(f) â€“ which Trump used for the travel ban â€“ ensuring itâ€™s used in a more tailored, evidence-based way. Public diplomacy will be crucial too: the administration should clearly communicate to the world that â€œMuslim Ban 2.0â€ is gone, and that America values its immigrant communities and foreign partners. By reversing EO 14166 and implementing these measures, a future administration can **repair the damage to Americaâ€™s diversity and alliances**, and replace fear-based exclusion with a security approach that is both effective and respects American ideals.  

## Executive Order 14167 â€“ **Unleashing American Energy**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œPollutersâ€™ Delight Actâ€* â€“ From a left-leaning perspective, this order is basically a **gift to Big Oil and Coal**, gutting environmental safeguards under the guise of â€œenergy freedomâ€ and accelerating climate destruction for corporate gain.  

**What it Does:** EO 14167 rolls back a wide swath of climate change policies and environmental regulations in order to **rapidly expand fossil fuel production and usage** in the United States. It explicitly rescinds many of President Bidenâ€™s executive actions aimed at climate mitigation and green energy transition ([Unleashing American Energy â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=,to%20Tackle%20the%20Climate%20Crisis)). For instance, it **revoked Bidenâ€™s day-one order (EO 13990) that had rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement and imposed stricter emissions standards, ([Unleashing American Energy â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=,to%20Tackle%20the%20Climate%20Crisis))** and it nixed other orders promoting clean energy and curbing fossil fuels â€“ including Bidenâ€™s pause on new oil/gas leases on federal lands and the mandate to factor the â€œsocial cost of carbonâ€ into decision-making. In fact, EO 14167 **disbanded the interagency working group on the social cost of greenhouse gases**, effectively telling agencies to ignore climate damages in their cost-benefit analyses ([Unleashing American Energy â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=Executive%20Order%2011991%20of%20May,is%20hereby%20revoked)). The order instructs agencies to **fast-track permits for oil and gas drilling, coal mining, and pipeline construction**, making â€œenergy dominanceâ€ a top priority. It also lifts or plans to rewrite various environmental rules seen as â€œburdensomeâ€ â€“ such as methane emissions limits on oil wells, efficiency standards for appliances, and possibly fuel economy standards for vehicles. Additionally, the EO directs a review and reversal of any regulations that might impede domestic energy projects, even referencing decades-old environmental rules for possible rollback (it even revoked a 1977 environmental quality order to streamline reviews) ([Unleashing American Energy â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=Executive%20Order%2011991%20of%20May,is%20hereby%20revoked)). Another key aspect is empowering states and industry: the order signals that **states hostile to federal climate action (e.g., Texas, West Virginia) will get more leeway to approve projects without federal interference**, and it seeks to prevent states from blocking energy infrastructure (for instance, by curtailing statesâ€™ authority under laws like the Clean Water Act to veto pipelines). In sum, EO 14167 aggressively **tilts the scales in favor of fossil fuel development** â€“ clearing obstacles, shutting down climate initiatives, and declaring that producing â€œaffordable, reliableâ€ (read: fossil) energy is the overriding policy of the land.  

**Claimed Purpose:** The Trump administration asserted that this order would **â€œrestore American prosperityâ€ and â€œenergy independenceâ€** by freeing industry from what it called unnecessary, â€œideologically motivatedâ€ regulations ([Unleashing American Energy â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=Section%201,while%20weakening%20our%20national%20security)) ([Unleashing American Energy â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=It%20is%20thus%20in%20the,will%20deliver%20peace%20through%20strength)). The EOâ€™s preamble argues that in recent years, burdensome environmental rules have driven up energy costs for consumers, killed jobs in fossil fuel sectors, and even threatened national security by making the U.S. more reliant on foreign energy ([Unleashing American Energy â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=Section%201,while%20weakening%20our%20national%20security)). By unleashing domestic oil, gas, and coal production, Trump claims we can have cheap gas and electricity, bring back high-paying industrial jobs, and achieve geopolitical strength (e.g., out-competing adversaries like Russia in energy exports). The order touts the idea that **American fossil fuels are the best in the world and should be maximized for economic gain**, and it even wraps itself in a populist mantle: helping â€œforgottenâ€ workers (such as coal miners and oil rig laborers) regain employment and decent wages ([Unleashing American Energy â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=It%20is%20thus%20in%20the,will%20deliver%20peace%20through%20strength)). Thereâ€™s also a stated intent to correct what Trump calls an overreach of the prior administration â€“ to â€œrestore scienceâ€ in a twisted sense by removing what he sees as climate â€œpoliticization.â€ Essentially, **Trump justified EO 14167 as stopping a supposed war on energy**. He claimed environmental rules only provided marginal (or dubious) benefits while imposing massive costs on industry and consumers, so removing them would benefit ordinary Americans with lower prices at the pump, lower utility bills, and a boom in jobs from drilling and mining. The framing was very much about *abundance* versus scarcity â€“ that the U.S. can have plentiful energy, strong growth, and be a global energy leader if not for pesky regulations. Thus, the order was pitched as patriotically â€œputting Americans firstâ€ in energy, harkening back to his first-term rhetoric of energy dominance.  

**Whatâ€™s Really Happening:** In truth, EO 14167 is a **blatant giveaway to fossil fuel corporations and a sabotage of urgent climate action**. It tosses aside the scientific consensus on climate change â€“ which sees the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions â€“ in favor of short-term oil, gas, and coal profits. By revoking Bidenâ€™s climate orders and withdrawing analytical tools like the social cost of carbon, Trump essentially directed the government to **stop considering climate change as a factor in decision-making ([Unleashing American Energy â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=Executive%20Order%2011991%20of%20May,is%20hereby%20revoked))**. That means when agencies evaluate, say, a new pipeline or a new drilling lease, they are now likely to ignore the long-term damage of the carbon pollution it will emit. This â€œsee no evilâ€ approach doesnâ€™t make the climate crisis go away; it just **institutionalizes climate denial within federal policy**. The supposed economic benefits are also dubious: while some fossil industry jobs might come back, it pits old energy jobs against burgeoning clean energy employment (solar and wind sectors which were growing rapidly now lose federal support, potentially causing job losses there). Moreover, whatever gains a few oil workers see, many more Americans could suffer from the resultant spikes in pollution â€“ like increased asthma and health costs from coal plant emissions as environmental standards are relaxed. The EOâ€™s push to eliminate â€œred tapeâ€ likely means cutting community input and environmental justice considerations from project approvals, meaning **communities (often low-income or minority) will have less say and protection when a refinery or pipeline is planned in their backyards**. Itâ€™s also worth noting that energy â€œindependenceâ€ was largely achieved under the prior administration through a balance of fossil and renewable growth; the U.S. was already a net exporter of energy. So Trumpâ€™s portrayal of the sector being shackled is exaggerated. The real effect is that companies get to pollute more freely â€“ **methane leaks from oil operations can increase without penalty, utilities might burn dirtier fuel without upgrading equipment, and protected lands could be opened up to drilling**. All of this accelerates climate change and environmental degradation. Essentially, EO 14167 represents Trump **taking the U.S. sharply backward** on energy: prioritizing 19th- and 20th-century fuels at the expense of the 21st-century clean energy transition, and doing so by dismissing science and public welfare. Itâ€™s a boon for fossil fuel executives and an alarming step for anyone concerned about climate and environmental health.  

**Broader Agenda Fit:** This energy EO exemplifies Trumpâ€™s broader **rejection of globalism and science in favor of nationalism and deregulation**. It aligns with his decision (first term) to quit the Paris Agreement and his alliance with climate-skeptic factions. By maximally exploiting fossil fuels, Trump asserts American sovereignty â€“ no â€œinternational climate elitesâ€ telling the U.S. how to run its economy. It fits neatly with the broader theme of **deregulating businesses** â€“ also seen in his EOs attacking regulations and DEI, etc. Ideologically, it underscores the administrationâ€™s alignment with extraction industries and its antipathy to the environmental movement, which Trump often dismisses as radical or anti-American. This order also resonates with Trumpâ€™s culture-war style politics: he often cast the climate issue as elitists vs. workers, where he sides with coal miners over â€œcoastal liberals.â€ In that sense, EO 14167 isnâ€™t just an economic policy; itâ€™s a cultural statement that **fossil fuels = American greatness** (think of his first term speeches extolling â€œbeautiful clean coalâ€ and revving motorcycle engines at rallies). So as part of his agenda, this EO helps solidify his support in fossil fuel-heavy states and among voters who are skeptical of climate change or resent environmental regulations. It also complements other second-term moves like gutting DEI and immigration: all share the common thread of **undoing the previous administrationâ€™s priorities** â€“ Bidenâ€™s climate focus in this case â€“ and reinforcing Trumpâ€™s vision of unfettered â€œfreedomâ€ for favored industries and demographics. Finally, itâ€™s consistent with Trumpâ€™s transactional worldview internationally: heâ€™d rather sell oil and gas abroad (and maybe undercut adversariesâ€™ markets) than participate in global climate initiatives. In sum, EO 14167 is a pillar of Trumpâ€™s agenda to **repudiate the climate-conscious, multilateral approach of the prior administration and entrench a fossil-fuel-centric, deregulatory regime** as a defining feature of his governance.  

**Harm Caused:** The harms of this executive order are **far-reaching and potentially irreversible for our planet**. In climate terms, the U.S. has now reneged on its emissions reduction commitments, meaning domestic greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise rather than fall. This contributes to more extreme weather events â€“ heatwaves, superstorms, wildfires â€“ that **hit Americans hard**, destroying homes and livelihoods. By greenlighting more coal burning and oil drilling, EO 14167 will over time add billions of tons of COâ‚‚ to the atmosphere, **intensifying global warming** and making the eventual task of climate stabilization much harder (future generations will pay the price in the form of more drastic measures needed later, or suffering the consequences). In the near term, Americansâ€™ **health is directly at risk**. Rollbacks on pollution standards mean more smog, soot, and toxic chemicals in our air and water. We can expect higher rates of asthma attacks, respiratory illnesses, and even premature deaths, especially in communities near refineries, power plants, or busy highways where fuel standards are loosened. The orderâ€™s push for drilling on public lands threatens precious ecosystems: we are likely to see habitat destruction in Arctic refuges, national forests, and coastal waters, jeopardizing wildlife from caribou to marine life. It also threatens Indigenous communities whose lands and sacred sites often overlap with resource-rich areas â€“ their voices were largely sidelined in Trumpâ€™s calculus. Economically, while a few fossil jobs might return, the **clean energy sector now faces a chilling effect**: investment in renewables may slow due to loss of federal support and market uncertainty, which in turn could cede leadership (and jobs) in the booming global clean tech market to competitors like China and the EU. Furthermore, by discouraging energy efficiency (through actions like removing appliance or building standards), the EO will **cost consumers more in the long run** â€“ any short-term drop in gasoline price is offset by higher bills due to inefficiency and unchecked utility rate hikes to pay for old coal plants. On the international stage, Americaâ€™s abdication of climate leadership means a coordination setback: other countries may also falter in their commitments, collectively worsening the climate crisis. Also, climate-fueled disasters abroad can spur instability and migration, some of which inevitably affects U.S. national security. In summary, EO 14167 **sacrifices the environment and climate stability on the altar of fossil fuel interests** â€“ leading to dirtier air and water for Americans, increased climate hazards, lost economic opportunities in green industries, and a heavier climate burden on future Americans. The damage done by a few years of this policy, in terms of carbon pumped into the sky or protections dismantled, can take decades to undo â€“ if it can be undone at all.  

**How a Future Administration Could Undo It:** Reversing the impacts of EO 14167 would be a top priority for any progressive administration, and it would likely begin on Inauguration Day. The new president can immediately **rejoin the fight against climate change** by reissuing the key orders Trump revoked â€“ for instance, signing an order to re-establish the social cost of carbon working group ([Unleashing American Energy â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=Executive%20Order%2011991%20of%20May,is%20hereby%20revoked)) and reinstate requirements that agencies account for climate impacts in their decisions. Regulatory rollbacks initiated under Trump could be halted and then reversed: the EPA and Department of Energy could move to **restore strict emissions standards** (for methane leaks, power plant emissions, vehicle fuel economy, etc.), albeit through rulemaking that might take time. Itâ€™s critical to also **re-tighten oversight on public lands**: a new administration can freeze new fossil fuel leases on federal lands and waters (as Biden did) and review recently issued leases for potential cancellation or additional environmental scrutiny. Many of Trumpâ€™s changes, especially if they went through formal rule changes, would require legal and procedural effort to undo â€“ for example, if environmental review rules (NEPA regulations) were weakened, theyâ€™d need to be rewritten to once again fully consider climate effects. But a committed administration can prioritize and expedite these reversals. Meanwhile, it can **renew Americaâ€™s commitment to clean energy**: restoring and increasing incentives for renewable energy deployment, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency programs that Trumpâ€™s order undermined. This not only counters the climate damage but also brings back jobs and innovation in those sectors. Another strategy is working with Congress: a new administration could push for legislative climate action (like renewable energy standards or carbon pricing) to lock in progress that canâ€™t be easily undone by future presidents. Funding for climate resilience and a just transition for fossil-dependent communities can help remediate some harm (ensuring coal miners have opportunities in reclamation or new industries, for instance). On the diplomatic front, rejoining the Paris Agreement (if the U.S. had effectively pulled away) and collaborating in international climate initiatives would help repair trust and momentum globally. Importantly, a future president should **clearly communicate to the American people the benefits of these reversals** â€“ emphasizing improved health, modern jobs, and the avoidance of climate catastrophes â€“ to build public support that makes these policy pivots durable. Time is of the essence: the next administration must not only undo Trumpâ€™s anti-climate actions but do so with greater ambition, effectively making up for lost time. By quickly overturning EO 14167 and implementing robust pro-climate policies, the U.S. can get back on track toward its emissions goals and ensure that the window for averting the worst of climate change is not slammed shut by Trumpâ€™s short-sighted agenda.  

## Executive Order 14168 â€“ **Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œThe Gender Bigotry Mandateâ€* â€“ Critics see this as the **institutionalization of transphobia**, an order that effectively erases transgender peopleâ€™s identity in the eyes of the federal government and promotes discrimination under the pretext of protecting women.  

**What it Does:** EO 14168 imposes a blanket policy across all federal agencies to **legally define gender strictly as oneâ€™s sex assigned at birth â€“ male or female, immutable and grounded in biology** ([Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring ...](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/#:~:text=,are%20grounded%20in%20fundamental)). In doing so, it reverses the inclusive policies of the previous administration which recognized gender identity in various contexts. Practically, this means the federal government will no longer acknowledge transgender (or non-binary) identities when enforcing laws and regulations. For example, under this order, Title IX (which bans sex discrimination in education) will be enforced by treating â€œsexâ€ as binary â€“ effectively **excluding transgender girls/women from girlsâ€™ or womenâ€™s sports and school facilities** by definition. Similarly, federal civil rights law (like Title VII employment discrimination) will be interpreted in a way that **does not protect gender identity or transgender status**, despite the Supreme Courtâ€™s Bostock decision (which Trumpâ€™s DOJ is likely ignoring or seeking to circumvent). EO 14168â€™s definitions were subsequently referenced and used to justify a slew of other policies: banning trans service members in the military, forbidding trans women from womenâ€™s homeless shelters or prisons, and denying recognition of gender changes in passports or Social Security records ([Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports/#:~:text=Sec,shall%20apply%20to%20this%20order)). All federal forms and data collection are to be aligned with this â€œbiological truth,â€ likely forcing agencies to revert to only â€œMâ€ or â€œFâ€ options and not accommodate anyone who doesnâ€™t fit. In essence, the order **eliminates all federal-level protections for transgender individuals** by defining them out of existence. It likely also directs federal health guidelines to treat transition-related care as outside the scope of protected or necessary healthcare. The language about â€œGender Ideology Extremismâ€ suggests the order might even forbid any federal funding or endorsement of materials that acknowledge transgender identities â€“ possibly impacting educational grants or research. Overall, EO 14168 enshrines a rigid, biologically deterministic view of sex into federal policy, **mandating that policies across education, healthcare, housing, employment, and more treat everyone strictly according to the sex on their original birth certificate**.  

**Claimed Purpose:** The Trump administration claimed this order was needed to **protect women and girlsâ€™ opportunities, safety, and privacy** from what they term â€œgender ideology extremism.â€ The narrative was that allowing transgender women (whom they refer to as â€œbiological malesâ€) into female spaces or sports undermines fairness and puts cisgender women at risk. By â€œrestoring biological truth,â€ Trump argued he was **upholding science and common sense** â€“ essentially saying that recognizing gender identity is a form of dangerous denial of biology. Supporters trotted out examples in sports where trans women outcompeted cisgender women, or instances (often distorted or rare) where a transgender inmate or student was accused of misconduct, to justify the need for this bright line policy to â€œdefendâ€ cisgender females. Additionally, the administration framed this as **protecting children**: they insinuated that acknowledging gender fluidity confuses kids and that this order would ensure young people are taught in line with â€œrealâ€ biology and not encouraged toward â€œradicalâ€ transitions. The title itself, with phrases like â€œGender Ideology Extremism,â€ paints the inclusion of transgender people as an extreme, fringe idea, thereby positioning Trumpâ€™s stance as the moderate, rational one. Officials likely cited polling or sentiments that many Americans are uncomfortable with some aspects of trans inclusion (like sports) to claim a popular mandate. Moreover, by using language of â€œfairnessâ€ and â€œdignity for women,â€ they tried to **cast the policy as a womenâ€™s rights initiative**. The notion of â€œdefending womenâ€ gave cover to what is effectively anti-transgender discrimination, allowing proponents to insist they are not targeting anyone out of hate, but rather preserving womenâ€™s equality as allegedly intended under laws like Title IX. In short, the order was sold as a necessary correction to what Trumpâ€™s base views as an out-of-control â€œwokeâ€ agenda â€“ a return to a supposedly self-evident truth that two sexes exist and thatâ€™s that, for the good of society and especially for women and girls.  

**Whatâ€™s Really Happening:** In reality, this order is **an assault on the civil rights and dignity of transgender Americans**. It effectively declares that the federal government will pretend transgender people do not exist or should not exist. By rigidly defining gender as immutable, the EO forces trans individuals into categories that do not reflect their identity, which will **deny them access to appropriate facilities, programs, and protections**. For example, a transgender woman could be forced into a menâ€™s prison or denied entry to a womenâ€™s domestic violence shelter, regardless of the danger or humiliation that poses, simply because of her birth sex. The claim of protecting womenâ€™s sports is largely a wedge â€“ high school and collegiate athletic bodies were already developing nuanced policies; Trumpâ€™s blanket ban approach ignores the complexities and effectively just kicks trans people out of competition rather than finding inclusive solutions. Importantly, EO 14168 **flies in the face of medical consensus** and legal precedent. Major medical organizations recognize transgender identities as real and support transition care; pretending otherwise in federal policy doesnâ€™t change individualsâ€™ lived reality, it just makes their lives much harder. Legally, the order is a direct challenge to the Supreme Courtâ€™s interpretation (in Bostock v. Clayton County) that anti-transgender discrimination is a form of sex discrimination. The administration is likely trying to undermine or narrow that via executive fiat, which is of dubious legality and certainly invites litigation. On the ground, the EOâ€™s implementation is cruel: Transgender federal employees potentially lose healthcare coverage for transition-related procedures. Trans youth at school are now effectively told by the government that their identity is invalid â€“ which can fuel bullying and stigma. Itâ€™s also critical to see that **this policy doesnâ€™t â€œprotectâ€ women so much as police and scrutinize them**. Cisgender women who donâ€™t conform to feminine norms (say, an athlete with a more muscular build or a woman with short hair and androgynous style) might face invasive gender checks or suspicion under these hardline rules â€“ exactly the kind of indignity that Title IX was designed to prevent in the first place. The order is less about safety and more about enforcing a conservative, binary gender ideology across society. It empowers those who seek to discriminate against transgender folks â€“ from schools expelling trans students from sports, to employers refusing to accommodate a transition, to health providers denying care â€“ by providing a federal blessing for such actions. Essentially, EO 14168 is **the culmination of a long anti-trans campaign: it encodes prejudice into policy**, harming a tiny and vulnerable minority (trans people) under the pretext of helping the majority (cisgender women), a tactic not unlike other historical civil rights rollbacks.  

**Broader Agenda Fit:** This order is a flagship of Trumpâ€™s larger **culture war, anti-â€œwokeâ€ agenda**. It sits alongside actions like banning DEI programs and censoring school curricula (as seen in other EOs) as part of a concerted effort to rollback progressive social changes. Particularly, it aligns with the hard-right Christian conservative and TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) movements that have been influential in GOP politics â€“ delivering on Trumpâ€™s campaign promises to â€œprotect womenâ€™s sportsâ€ and fight â€œgender insanity,â€ as he often put it. This EO furthers the broader narrative that **Trump is the defender of traditional values** and that under him the government rejects what he labels â€œpolitical correctnessâ€ around gender. Itâ€™s a companion to the administrationâ€™s moves against reproductive rights and LGBQ rights (e.g., allowing discrimination based on sexual orientation under religious freedom claims) â€“ all pieces in the puzzle of enforcing a conservative moral order. By targeting a minority group that lacks broad public understanding or support, Trump solidifies a base rallying point and distracts from other issues (itâ€™s a classic â€œdivide and conquerâ€ strategy in politics, finding scapegoats). Also, administratively, it shows Trumpâ€™s willingness to upend established interpretations of law (like Title IX and Title VII) by executive fiat, reflecting his general approach of asserting power and daring courts or Congress to stop him. Notably, this anti-trans order fits his pattern of undermining civil rights enforcement infrastructure: just as he undercut racial equity and environmental justice efforts elsewhere, here he is undercutting LGBTQ+ rights efforts. In the context of Trumpâ€™s ideology, itâ€™s about rejecting the idea that government should protect gender minorities; instead, government should enforce a traditional social norm. The EO also had an element of trolling the left â€“ it was rolled out with fanfare to press the outrage button, which in turn he uses as evidence that heâ€™s fighting the culturally â€œradicalâ€ left. In summary, EO 14168 perfectly encapsulates Trumpâ€™s second-term ethos: **aggressively push the most extreme version of right-wing cultural policy, take joy in liberalsâ€™ consternation, and claim to be restoring the nation to some bygone sense of â€œnormalâ€ that never truly existed for many Americans**.  

**Harm Caused:** The harm to transgender Americans from this order is **immeasurable and deeply personal**. It instantaneously sent a message that their own government does not see them as who they are â€“ a devastating psychological blow to a community already facing high rates of depression and suicide due to stigma. In practical terms, trans individuals started experiencing **increased discrimination in daily life**: reports emerged of trans students being forced to use wrong bathrooms or being misgendered officially at school, causing humiliation and distress. Transgender federal workers lost protections; for instance, a trans woman employed by a federal agency could find that her HR records revert to â€œmaleâ€ and colleagues no longer required to respect her identity, fostering a hostile workplace that might push her out. Access to healthcare became more fraught â€“ insurers and providers, seeing the federal stance, felt emboldened to deny coverage for gender-affirming care (labeling it experimental or unnecessary) even when it can be life-saving. On a societal level, **anti-trans harassment and violence climbed**. Bigots feel vindicated when the highest office in the land validates their prejudice; activists on the ground noted a chilling effect where transphobic rhetoric intensified and hate crimes and bullying incidents rose. Meanwhile, cisgender women and girls did not tangibly benefit as claimed â€“ their sports and spaces were no safer in reality, since trans people had not been causing the problems Trump described. In fact, some women suffered harm: imagine a cisgender female athlete with naturally high testosterone being subjected to invasive testing or outright banned under the stricter gender policing environment, akin to whatâ€™s happened to intersex athletes under world sports rules. So the EO managed to create **new problems where there were none**, like schools now spending time and money enforcing gender rules rather than educating. Legally, the order set up conflicts that caused turmoil: civil rights offices at Education and Justice that had been processing complaints of anti-trans discrimination abruptly shifted to possibly investigate schools *for* accommodating trans students. Some states and districts defied the EO, leading to threats of funding cuts or lawsuits â€“ and trans youth in those battlegrounds were caught in the middle of a confusing, traumatic fight over their existence. The harm also extends to research and data: by erasing the category of gender identity, the federal government stops collecting data on trans populations in surveys, making it harder to address their needs or even acknowledge disparities (this echoes how ignoring a problem can perpetuate it by lack of evidence). Intangibly but critically, EO 14168 **coarsened the national discourse** and encouraged other forms of intolerance. When the government targets one minority, others fear they could be next, and overall social cohesion frays. The trust transgender people might have had in public institutions â€“ police, schools, healthcare â€“ eroded further, with serious implications: e.g., a trans person might now avoid going to the hospital for an emergency, afraid of mistreatment, which could lead to worse health outcomes or even death. All told, the order inflicted widespread emotional and material harm on an already marginalized group and **set back the cause of equality and acceptance significantly**.  

**How a Future Administration Could Undo It:** A humane and progressive administration would waste no time in **revoking EO 14168** in its entirety. On Day One, the new president can issue an order or directive that **reinstates the definition of gender to include gender identity** for all federal purposes, aligning with the reasoning of the Supreme Court and modern medical understanding. This would immediately restore policies that allow transgender individuals to, for example, use facilities matching their gender at federal buildings and reinstate coverage of transition-related healthcare in federal insurance. The administration should direct the Department of Education to **re-issue guidance under Title IX protecting transgender students**, effectively undoing Trumpâ€™s reinterpretation and once again forbidding discrimination based on gender identity in schools. Similarly, the Department of Justice can clarify that it will enforce sex discrimination laws (like Title VII) to cover gender identity (essentially returning to the status quo recognized by courts). In the military, the new Commander-in-Chief can order the armed forces to reopen service to transgender members, as had been done before, and ensure any personnel discharged or harmed by Trumpâ€™s policy are rehabilitated or given an opportunity to rejoin. To address the damages, the government should actively reach out to the transgender community: **re-establish advisory councils or liaisons on LGBTQ+ issues** to advise on reversing bureaucratic setbacks (like updating federal IDs with correct gender markers easily). It would also help to **educate and train federal employees** quickly â€“ making sure that all managers and staff understand that anti-trans harassment or misgendering is once again considered discrimination and wonâ€™t be tolerated. Some of the harm â€“ like lost trust â€“ will take time to heal, but strong symbolic and concrete actions (e.g., inviting transgender advocates to White House events, highlighting Pride, etc.) can signal a sea change. Additionally, a new administration could champion legislation such as the Equality Act, which would amend federal civil rights law to explicitly include gender identity â€“ providing more permanent protection that a future Trump-like president canâ€™t as easily overturn. In terms of sports and prisons and other sensitive areas, the new leadership can replace Trumpâ€™s blunt bans with **nuanced, case-by-case policies** developed with expert input, ensuring fairness and safety for all while not arbitrarily excluding trans people. Finally, resources should be allocated to **undo damage on the ground**: grants for anti-bullying programs in schools, support for mental health services for LGBTQ+ youth, and public information campaigns to counter the misinformation spread by the prior administration about transgender individuals. By taking these steps, a future administration can not only reverse EO 14168 but also hopefully **advance to a stronger position than before** â€“ one where transgender Americans know their rights are secure and their government has their back.  

## Executive Order 14169 â€“ **Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œThe Classroom Censorship and Surveillance Orderâ€* â€“ This is viewed by progressives as a **thought-policing edict** that censors honest education about race and gender, and intimidates schools into carrying out a right-wing ideological agenda.  

**What it Does:** EO 14169 targets public education, directing the federal government to crack down on K-12 schools that the Trump administration deems to be engaging in â€œradicalâ€ or â€œdiscriminatoryâ€ teaching. It **bans any curricula, training, or student activities that involve what it calls â€œdiscriminatory equity ideologyâ€ or â€œcritical race theoryâ€** â€“ essentially prohibiting teachings that acknowledge systemic racism, white privilege, or gender identity diversity ([Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/#:~:text=as%20members%20of%20preferred%20or,color%2C%20sex%2C%20or%20national%20origin)) ([Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/#:~:text=national%20origin%2C%20should%20be%20discriminated,LEA)). The order declares that such content is a violation of studentsâ€™ civil rights or parental rights, and it leverages federal funding to enforce compliance. In practice, EO 14169 instructs the Department of Education to withhold or withdraw federal funds (like Title I or other grants) from school districts that include lessons on institutional racism or comprehensive sex/gender education that includes LGBTQ topics. It also presumably empowers the Department of Justice to investigate and bring legal action against schools for alleged â€œdiscriminationâ€ if, say, a teacher discusses concepts like implicit bias or uses materials like the 1619 Project. The EOâ€™s language explicitly references enforcing existing civil rights laws (like Title VI, which prohibits race discrimination, and Title IX for sex discrimination) to **argue that teaching about racism or gender diversity is itself a form of unlawful bias or indoctrination ([Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/#:~:text=My%20Administration%20will%20enforce%20the,1232h))**. Moreover, EO 14169 **requires schools to inform parents and obtain consent for any instructional content related to sex, gender identity, or other so-called sensitive matters**, effectively giving parents veto power and encouraging challenges to things like sex ed or anti-bullying programs. It also mandates that federal education programs and funds not be used to support diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in schools ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Empowers Parents, States ...](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-empowers-parents-states-and-communities-to-improve-education-outcomes/#:~:text=Fact%20Sheet%3A%20President%20Donald%20J,DEI%20or%20gender%20ideology)) ([Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling - The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/#:~:text=Eliminating%20Federal%20funding%20or%20support,on%20gender%20ideology%20and)) (per cross-reference from other docs). The order likely set up a mechanism (like a task force or hotline) for parents to report â€œindoctrination,â€ inviting federal scrutiny of local classrooms. It could be seen as a national version of state â€œanti-CRTâ€ laws: teachers might be required to post lesson plans online, allow parental review of all materials, or face penalties if they broach prohibited topics. In summary, EO 14169 puts the weight of the federal government behind a **sweeping censorship and surveillance regime in education** â€“ stamping out progressive teachings on history, social justice, and identity under threat of losing funding or facing legal action.  

**Claimed Purpose:** The Trump administration asserted that this order was necessary to **protect children from harmful, anti-American indoctrination and to uphold studentsâ€™ and parentsâ€™ civil rights**. They argued that certain educators were pushing divisive concepts â€“ like telling white children they are inherently oppressors or forcing a â€œpolitical agendaâ€ about gender fluidity onto kids â€“ thereby violating the principles of equality and parental authority ([Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/#:~:text=Imprinting%20anti,Similarly%2C%20demanding)) ([Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/#:~:text=rights%20law%20in%20many%20cases%2C,discrimination%20and%20undermines%20national%20unity)). Trumpâ€™s team claimed that **teaching about systemic racism or gender theory actually constitutes discrimination** against students (particularly white, male, or Christian students who might feel â€œguilt or anguishâ€ from those lessons) ([Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/#:~:text=as%20members%20of%20preferred%20or,color%2C%20sex%2C%20or%20national%20origin)). By framing it this way, they repurposed civil rights terminology: in their view, an anti-racist curriculum was ironically racist against whites, and an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum was biased against those with traditional beliefs. They also leaned heavily on the notion of parental rights â€“ maintaining that parents have the ultimate say in their childrenâ€™s education, and that schools hiding or promoting content about sexuality or race without explicit parental approval is a breach of trust and rights. The EO invoked examples (often anecdotal or exaggerated) of outrageous classroom practices â€“ e.g., very young kids being asked about their gender identity, or assignments that separate students by race for privilege exercises â€“ to stoke anger and justify broad intervention. **Patriotism and unity were also themes**: Trump contended that he was stopping activists from teaching kids to â€œhate Americaâ€ or hate each other, and instead ensuring schools focus on a unifying, patriotic education that celebrates American values. In short, the administration sold EO 14169 as a **shield for childrenâ€™s minds and parental control** â€“ preventing â€œMarxistâ€ or â€œwokeâ€ educators from brainwashing youth, and returning education to basics of reading, writing, arithmetic and a version of history that is proud and non-divisive.  

**Whatâ€™s Really Happening:** In effect, EO 14169 is **federalizing a culture war in schools**, attempting to silence discussions of race and gender equity by falsely equating them with discrimination. It takes legitimate educational content â€“ like learning about the history of slavery, segregation, and ongoing racial inequality, or acknowledging the existence and rights of LGBTQ people â€“ and brands it as â€œradical indoctrination.â€ This is a highly politicized distortion. The order punishes schools for doing exactly what education should do: teaching critical thinking about society and fostering inclusion. The supposed protection of studentsâ€™ rights is a smokescreen â€“ in practice, this order **infringes on the academic freedom of teachers and the right of students (especially those from marginalized groups) to receive an accurate and validating education**. The fear of losing funds forces schools into self-censorship. Teachers, worried about their district being penalized or about their own jobs, will shy away from any topic that could be deemed controversial under this vague and sweeping order. That means **less honest talk about Americaâ€™s history of racism or contemporary issues like Black Lives Matter** â€“ depriving students of a complete understanding of their country. It also means **erasing LGBTQ people from lessons**, which directly harms queer youth who feel unseen or stigmatized, and fosters ignorance among their peers. The parental rights emphasis, in practice, emboldens a vocal minority of parents to dictate curricula for all, often in line with conservative or religious views â€“ effectively undermining professional educators and the interests of other families who *do* want comprehensive, truthful education. Additionally, EO 14169 tasks federal agencies with enforcement in a domain typically controlled by states and localities; this is a heavy-handed overreach that ironically betrays conservative principles of local control. Schools might face intrusive investigations or litigation not because they violated any actual anti-discrimination laws as written, but because Trumpâ€™s DOE/DOJ reinterpreted those laws backwards. It creates a chilling effect where **even discussing diversity or implicit bias is perceived as dangerous**. Meanwhile, real issues like racial achievement gaps or bullying of minority students get harder to address if educators fear any tailored support could be seen as â€œpreferringâ€ one group and thus illegal by this EOâ€™s twisted logic ([Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/#:~:text=as%20members%20of%20preferred%20or,color%2C%20sex%2C%20or%20national%20origin)). Essentially, the order wages a war on â€œwokenessâ€ at the expense of studentsâ€™ right to knowledge. It privileges a sanitized, status-quo version of education that leaves students ill-prepared to navigate and improve a diverse society. The actual result is not unity, but rather **enforced ignorance and division**, as students are taught a skewed narrative and those from minority backgrounds see their histories and identities suppressed or treated as taboo.  

**Broader Agenda Fit:** This education order is a cornerstone of Trumpâ€™s broader **â€œanti-wokeâ€ crusade**, complementing his actions on DEI rollback and gender definitions. It aligns perfectly with the efforts by Republican legislatures around the country to ban critical race theory and censor school libraries â€“ Trump basically took that playbook national. It serves the agenda of rallying the conservative base around protecting children from â€œthe left.â€ By stirring up fears of indoctrination, Trump taps into a potent cultural grievance that has been building on the right, uniting social conservatives (worried about sex ed and LGBTQ issues) with those antagonistic toward anti-racism efforts. Itâ€™s also part of Trumpâ€™s ongoing attempt to **rewrite the national narrative** in his image: similar to how he formed the short-lived â€œ1776 Commissionâ€ late in his first term to promote patriotic education, EO 14169 is pushing that vision aggressively. This lines up with his general disdain for expertise and intellectuals â€“ painting teachers and academics as untrustworthy elites trying to subvert American values, which resonates with his populist stance. Moreover, it underlines the authoritarian streak in his agenda: willing to use federal power to enforce ideological conformity and punish dissent (in this case, dissenting ideas in a classroom). By doing so, Trump not only energizes his supporters but also attempts to shape the next generationâ€™s worldview in a way that favors his politics (e.g., downplaying racism means less support for policies addressing it, which aligns with his and the GOPâ€™s platform). In a larger sense, this EO is one front in a multi-front war on progressive values and factual discourse â€“ alongside attacks on the media (â€œfake newsâ€) and science (climate denial), heâ€™s now attacking education. Itâ€™s an effort to control the narrative, to sow distrust of institutions that might counter his propaganda, and to assert that **only a Trump-approved version of reality should be taught**. As part of Trumpâ€™s ideological agenda, this is about cementing a conservative, nationalist worldview and stoking the grievance that conservatives/Christians/whites are the real victims in modern America. Itâ€™s red meat to that base, and a promise that under Trump, the government itself will fight the culture wars on their side.  

**Harm Caused:** The damage from this order is **already being felt in classrooms and beyond**. Teachers describe a climate of fear and confusion â€“ theyâ€™re second-guessing their lesson plans, avoiding literature by authors of color or discussions on civil rights, worried that a single parent complaint could jeopardize their schoolâ€™s funding or their career. This has a chilling effect on education quality: many educators are effectively teaching with â€œgagsâ€ on, meaning **students receive a watered-down curriculum**. History classes might skip over Reconstruction or redlining; English classes might avoid important works dealing with race or gender. Students, therefore, **lose access to knowledge and critical thinking opportunities**, especially around understanding social issues and empathy for different perspectives. For students of color, the implicit message is that their history and experiences canâ€™t be openly discussed â€“ which can be alienating and harmful to their sense of self. Likewise, LGBTQ students, or those from families with same-sex parents, find that their existence is treated as unspeakable; this kind of erasure can contribute to depression or self-harm for queer youth, who already face high risk when unsupported. The EOâ€™s stress on parental oversight has emboldened some extreme parent groups to harass schools â€“ there are more reports of heated school board confrontations, demands to remove books from libraries, and even teachers being falsely accused of indoctrination. All this conflict disrupts school operations and detracts from actual teaching and learning time. Some schools or districts, particularly in progressive areas, may try to quietly resist or ignore the EO, but they then **risk federal retaliation**, creating a patchwork where studentsâ€™ education depends on local political dynamics, exacerbating inequality. The threat to pull federal funds is huge: if actually carried out, it could strip already underfunded schools (often in poorer, urban districts) of crucial resources, harming the very students Trump claims to protect. That could mean cuts to Title I programs (for low-income students), or IDEA funds (for special education), ironically hurting vulnerable populations under the guise of protecting them from â€œindoctrination.â€ Additionally, the EO undermines trust in education as a public good â€“ by casting educators as potential villains and encouraging constant monitoring and suspicion, it erodes the student-teacher relationship. Students may parrot what they think is â€œsafeâ€ rather than engage honestly, stunting genuine learning. In the bigger picture, an entire cohort of students may graduate with a **skewed or incomplete understanding of their countryâ€™s challenges**, making them less prepared to navigate college discourse or a diverse workforce, and perhaps more susceptible to misinformation (since they werenâ€™t allowed to critically examine controversial topics in a guided environment). Moreover, communities have become more divided as education becomes a battlefield: rather than schools bringing people together, they are now zones of contention due to this order. It sets a precedent for further intrusion of ideology in education, which could have a long-term corrosive effect on American democracy â€“ after all, a well-informed citizenry is crucial, and this EO actively works against that by promoting ignorance of systemic issues.  

**How a Future Administration Could Undo It:** To reverse the corrosive effects of EO 14169, a new administration would move quickly on multiple fronts. **First**, it would explicitly rescind this executive order, immediately halting any federal investigations or funding actions that were initiated under its mandate. The Department of Educationâ€™s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) would be directed to revert to its previous interpretation of civil rights laws â€“ meaning **stopping the misuse of Title VI and Title IX to police curriculum**, and instead reaffirming that those laws permit educational discussions of race and gender as long as no student is being intentionally discriminated against. The DOJ would similarly drop any active cases or threats against districts over so-called â€œindoctrination,â€ refocusing on genuine civil rights violations (like racial segregation or denial of LGBTQ student rights *because* of who they are, not because of what is taught). **Second**, new guidance would be issued to schools affirming their ability to teach honest history and inclusion without fear. The Department of Education could release a Dear Colleague letter clarifying that discussions of systemic racism or sexuality, when age-appropriate, do not violate federal laws and in fact can further schoolsâ€™ obligations to provide equal opportunity (e.g., by fostering an inclusive environment for marginalized students). This clarification would go a long way to reassure educators. Concurrently, any â€œtip linesâ€ or mechanisms that were set up for parents to report teachers to federal authorities would be dismantled, and instead perhaps replaced with channels for reporting *actual* discrimination or harassment, thus flipping the script back to protecting student civil rights in the traditional sense. **Third**, the new administration would likely revive initiatives like the support for culturally responsive teaching and diversity training that Trumpâ€™s order quashed. Grants that had been frozen or banned from touching DEI content could be reauthorized â€“ for example, reinstating funding for anti-bias training programs or ethnic studies development that were demonized by the prior administration. On the legislative side, while education is mostly local, Congress could be urged to put guardrails: maybe clarifying that the federal government cannot condition funds on curricular content beyond established standards, to avoid a future Trump from doing this again (though that might be tricky). **Fourth**, itâ€™s important to invest in repairing the damage. The administration could sponsor national teach-ins or support professional development for teachers to rebuild confidence in covering difficult topics. Education leaders would likely convene with school boards and state education departments to encourage removal of any local policies that mirrored the EOâ€™s intent (since many states passed anti-CRT laws, a national change in stance could provide cover for repealing or softening those). **Fifth**, to directly support affected students and teachers, the administration might increase funding for mental health and counseling in schools â€“ recognizing that the previous period of censorship and conflict took a toll â€“ and promote community dialogues to heal divisions stirred up by the â€œindoctrinationâ€ panic. Symbolically, a new President might do what Biden did in 2021 â€“ openly acknowledge the need to teach about Americaâ€™s flaws as well as its strengths, perhaps by reinstating something like the 1776 Commissionâ€™s counter (Biden had disbanded that commission; a new approach could be to empower the Department of Education to highlight best practices in inclusive history education). Essentially, undoing EO 14169 isnâ€™t just about deleting a policy; itâ€™s about **reasserting the principle that educators can teach truth and students deserve a full education**. By swiftly nullifying Trumpâ€™s order and actively encouraging honest, inclusive teaching, a future administration can help ensure that our schools return to being places of learning rather than ideological battlegrounds, and that students gain both knowledge and critical thinking skills to help unite (not divide) our nation in the long run.  

## Executive Order 14170 â€“ **Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œThe Trans Youth Health Banâ€* â€“ From a left perspective, this order is a **brutal attack on transgender youth**, cynically dubbed to sound protective but in reality denying medically recommended care and stigmatizing trans children and their families.  

**What it Does:** EO 14170 targets healthcare related to gender transition for minors, aiming to **halt access to gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender youth at the national level**. In execution, the order directs that no federal funds â€“ be it Medicaid, Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or federal grants to clinics/hospitals â€“ can be used for any â€œgender transition proceduresâ€ on individuals under 18 ([Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/#:~:text=Protecting%20Children%20from%20Chemical%20and,from%20one%20sex%20to%20another)). This means puberty blockers, hormone therapies, and gender-affirming surgeries for minors would not be covered by any federal health insurance or funding. Given that many states use federal Medicaid funds, this effectively pressures states to cease covering these treatments too. Furthermore, the EO likely instructs federal agencies (like HHS) to **withhold certain federal health grants from any providers or programs that offer gender-affirming care to minors**, labeling such care as harmful. It also calls on the Department of Justice to **prioritize enforcing laws or pursuing action against healthcare providers who administer these treatments to minors**, under the premise that it might violate minorsâ€™ rights or constitute abuse. Indeed, the orderâ€™s language of â€œchemical and surgical mutilationâ€ implies a perspective that this care is abuse, so one could anticipate federal efforts to treat the provision of, say, puberty blockers as something illegal or punishable (even though it was legal and standard-of-care in many places). Additionally, EO 14170 probably supports parents who object to gender-affirming care â€“ for example, it could be used to argue that a parent who opposes their minor childâ€™s transition must be given deference, potentially intervening in custody situations to block affirming parents. In public health terms, the order might cut funding for research on gender dysphoria or training for gender care, thereby **freezing the medical communityâ€™s progress**. It also aligns with and boosts state bans: by making it federal policy to condemn trans healthcare for minors, it provides political cover and possibly resources to states enacting their own bans. The overarching effect is to create a chilling effect: doctors and clinics across the country would likely stop offering these services to minors for fear of losing funding or facing prosecution. In summary, EO 14170 **nationalizes a ban on gender-affirming medical care for trans youth**, wielding federal financial power and legal threats to shutter treatment access in every state.  

**Claimed Purpose:** The Trump administration framed this order as a measure to **protect vulnerable children from irreversible and harmful medical procedures**. They argued that minors are too young to make life-altering decisions about their gender, and thus should not be given puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or surgeries like mastectomies or genital surgeries (which are actually very rarely done on minors anyway). Using charged language like â€œchemical castrationâ€ and â€œgenital mutilation,â€ they depicted gender-affirming treatments as barbaric, experimental interventions pushed on kids by ideological adults or profit-seeking clinics. Trump positioned himself as **defending kidsâ€™ innocence and bodily integrity**, suggesting that many will â€œgrow out ofâ€ trans identities if not rushed into medical transition. He also claimed to be upholding parentsâ€™ rights â€“ implying that in some cases, youths are put on these treatments due to schools or doctors without full parental consent (playing into disinformation that schools start kids on hormones secretly). By invoking the term â€œmutilation,â€ the administration sought to link gender-affirming care with practices like FGM (female genital mutilation) which are broadly condemned, thereby rallying consensus that whatever falls under that loaded term must be stopped. They also likely cited a few de-transitioners (individuals who later regretted transitioning) as cautionary tales of what happens without such a ban. The justification tied into health and safety: claiming that puberty blockers have dangerous side effects or that surgeries leave permanent scars and sterility, thus the government has a duty to intervene and safeguard childrenâ€™s health. In essence, the order was sold as **rescuing children from abuse** â€“ a dramatic narrative where the government steps in to halt what they frame as medical malpractice or ideological influence harming kids. Itâ€™s pitched in compassionate terms (â€œprotect kids from harmâ€), which masks the cruelty of denying identity-affirming care. By presenting it this way, Trump aimed to garner not just support from his base but also from some moderate or uninformed people who might have knee-jerk discomfort with youth transitioning and could be swayed by the notion of protecting minors.  

**Whatâ€™s Really Happening:** Beneath the rhetoric, EO 14170 is **actively harming transgender youth by stripping them of medically endorsed care that can be crucial for their well-being**. The major medical authorities (American Academy of Pediatrics, Endocrine Society, etc.) have established standards of care for treating gender-dysphoric youth, which typically involve carefully evaluated use of puberty blockers and later hormones in teens, with surgeries generally not before 18 except in rare cases. By labeling these interventions â€œmutilationâ€ and banning them, Trumpâ€™s order completely ignores the existing medical consensus and the **evidence that gender-affirming care significantly improves mental health outcomes** for trans youth (reducing risks of depression, anxiety, and suicide). Instead, it enforces one particular ideological view â€“ that trans identities are temporary or invalid â€“ onto all families and doctors, regardless of individual needs. The consequence is that **transgender adolescents going through puberty will have no access to puberty blockers**, forcing them to endure physical changes that can cause intense distress (and which later may require more invasive procedures to reverse, if they transition as adults). Essentially, itâ€™s making their dysphoria worse by design. Those already on treatment may have had it abruptly cut off, which is traumatic and destabilizing. The order also likely fuels stigma: calling the standard care â€œmutilationâ€ sends a clear message that trans identities are not to be respected but rather seen as pathological or as a form of self-harm. This could discourage families from supporting their trans kids â€“ some parents might feel empowered to block care or even remove their kids from affirming environments, thinking the government backs them. Meanwhile, supportive parents are put in an agonizing position: either watch your child suffer without care or risk traveling out of country or underground for help, potentially at great cost. Many will simply be unable to get any care due to financial or logistical barriers increased by the EO. This policy also **criminalizes doctorsâ€™ best judgement**. Many healthcare providers will step away from treating trans youth, not wanting to risk legal trouble or loss of practice, which erodes trust in the medical system for trans people broadly. And the scientific research in this field will suffer due to federal disapproval and funding cuts, meaning less data and knowledge going forward. The EO doesnâ€™t make trans youth cease to exist; it just **condemns them to more hardship** â€“ higher incidences of severe dysphoria, possibly more self-harm or suicide attempts, and certainly a message from society that their lives are not valued. Another real-time effect: clinics that cater to trans youth (some being multidisciplinary, offering counseling, etc.) might shut down, which can also remove mental health support that these teens need regardless of medical transition. In short, behind the guise of protection, whatâ€™s happening is the **denial of essential healthcare and support to a small, vulnerable population**, likely leading to increased mental health crises, family conflicts, and even black-market hormone use (as desperate youth seek alternatives). This order is an extreme intrusion of government into personal medical decisions, overriding families, youth, and doctors in a one-size-fits-all ban that will cause far more suffering than it prevents.  

**Broader Agenda Fit:** EO 14170 is a key piece of Trumpâ€™s wider assault on LGBTQ+ rights, especially focusing on transgender issues where he and the right see a potent culture war front. It aligns with the series of anti-trans moves (like banning trans people from the military, redefining gender in EO 14168, and pushing school policies against trans students). It also mirrors and amplifies a trend in Republican-led states passing laws to ban gender-affirming care for minors â€“ Trump is essentially federalizing that agenda. By doing so, heâ€™s cementing his alliance with religious conservatives who consider such care immoral, and with far-right activists who have made â€œprotect the childrenâ€ their rallying cry against the trans community. This fits into the broader narrative of the Trump-era GOP positioning itself as the guardian of traditional gender norms: just as they want to force trans people â€œbackâ€ to their birth sex roles, they similarly attacked reproductive rights (leading to Roe v. Wadeâ€™s overturn) â€“ both are about controlling bodily autonomy in line with conservative doctrine. Trumpâ€™s agenda here is also about creating a wedge issue. Few things rally his base more than the topic of trans youth in recent times â€“ it touches fears about parental control, sexuality, and the future generation. By taking this strong stance, he also tries to portray Democrats as the party that â€œwants to mutilate children,â€ a horrific mischaracterization but one that could be politically effective in campaigns. So electorally and ideologically, itâ€™s a red-meat issue that connects to QAnon-adjacent conspiracy themes (e.g., children in danger from evil forces) which have permeated some of his followersâ€™ thinking. Additionally, Trumpâ€™s anti-expertise, anti-establishment bent is satisfied here by overruling medical authorities and painting them as corrupt or ideologically driven â€“ itâ€™s consistent with his approach of undermining professionals (be it scientists, doctors, or generals) and asserting his own narrative as truth. And of course, it dovetails with his â€œAmerica Firstâ€ nationalist framing too, as some advisors conflate gender-affirming care with decadent Western liberalism; by banning it, they claim to strengthen the nationâ€™s moral fiber. In summary, the order isnâ€™t an isolated policy â€“ itâ€™s a critical component of Trumpâ€™s reactionary social agenda that seeks to legislate conservative morality, rally his base around a manufactured crisis, and eradicate progressive gains for LGBTQ rights. It telegraphs that under Trump, the federal government is not neutral or protective regarding minority rights, but an active combatant to impose traditionalist values.  

**Harm Caused:** The human cost of this order is grievous. **Transgender youth who were receiving or anticipating medical care have essentially had hope pulled out from under them**. Many trans adolescents experience dysphoria so intense that puberty can trigger severe mental health crises; puberty blockers, when available, provided relief and time. Now, without that option, these teenagers are enduring puberty changes that they know feel wrong for them â€“ voice deepening, breasts developing, body hair, menstruation, etc., depending on their birth sex â€“ each day of that can be torment. We can expect a tragic increase in mental health emergencies: crisis hotlines and therapists are already reporting spikes in distress calls from trans youth in states with bans; a nationwide ban ups that exponentially. **Suicidality among trans youth**, which was already high relative to general population (due to stigma and dysphoria), is likely to rise as young people feel trapped and unsupported. Families are also put under extreme strain. Affirming parents now face the horrifying scenario of watching their childâ€™s mental health deteriorate while their hands are tied. Some will resort to costly measures â€“ perhaps moving states or even countries if they can afford, or seeking underground networks for meds (which is dangerous because dosing and purity can be issues). Less resourced families, often already marginalized, will suffer quietly and perhaps see their childâ€™s academic performance and social life collapse under the weight of untreated dysphoria and depression. **Medical harm** is another aspect: youths denied blockers will undergo puberty that might later be reversed with hormones or surgeries, but thatâ€™s a more involved, risky, and in some cases less effective route. For instance, a trans man (born female) who canâ€™t get blockers may develop breasts and curves, and later if he has chest surgery, heâ€™ll have had to undergo an invasive procedure that might have been unnecessary if blockers prevented development in the first place. Similarly, a trans woman (born male) forced through male puberty will have features like an Adamâ€™s apple, facial hair, and a deeper voice â€“ some of which are irreversible or require risky surgeries (like vocal cord surgery) to alter. So **physical harm and medical complexity increases** for these individuals down the line. Healthcare providers also face a moral and professional crisis: pediatric endocrinologists and gender specialists who know the standard of care now face either shutting down service to patients theyâ€™ve followed for years or attempting to help in secret or refer abroad â€“ all fraught with legal and ethical challenges. Many clinicians will feel moral injury from being forced to violate their oath to do whatâ€™s best for patients. The broader trans community (even adults) feels the harm too: they see their youth targeted, which exacerbates fear and minority stress among all trans people, and likely emboldens those who harass or attack transgender individuals in general. On a community level, this policy drives wedges between parents and children â€“ trans teens might become distrustful or resentful of parents who support the ban, and even in supportive families, the inability to get help might cause tension or despair. We could also witness more **runaway youth** â€“ desperate trans teens might flee unsupportive homes or states in search of care or acceptance, putting them at risk of homelessness or exploitation. The harm also extends to **scientific and public health understanding**: by chilling research, we could lag in improving care or understanding long-term outcomes, meaning even when policies reverse, weâ€™ve lost time in evidence-gathering that could help refine treatment protocols. Finally, consider the harm to trust in government and medicine: trans folks and allies see the government blatantly lying about and forbidding legitimate healthcare, which can breed cynicism and alienation from civic life; simultaneously, others are taught not to trust doctors (since the government casts doctors as mutilators) which could hamper public health efforts beyond trans care. In essence, EO 14170 is **traumatizing an entire generation of transgender youth**, likely resulting in more mental health crises, potential self-harm, disrupted lives and futures, and even loss of life â€“ truly a devastating legacy.  

**How a Future Administration Could Undo It:** Immediately reversing EO 14170 would be a top priority for a progressive administration committed to science and LGBTQ rights. **First**, the new president would revoke the order and issue a clear statement that **federal policy is to support evidence-based, gender-affirming care for those who need it, including minors** in consultation with doctors, patients, and families. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could swiftly update its regulations to explicitly allow Medicaid and other federal health programs to cover gender-affirming treatments for minors when deemed medically necessary. They might also make clear that denying such care can be a form of discrimination on the basis of sex (tying into Section 1557 of the ACA, which prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded health programs â€“ under Biden, HHS interpreted this to cover gender identity). This would protect providers and patients legally by framing gender-affirming care bans as potentially violating civil rights law, thus undoing Trumpâ€™s attempt to treat the care itself as abuse. **Second**, the DOJ would cease any actions against providers or parents. Instead, the DOJ Civil Rights Division could refocus on protecting the rights of transgender youth â€“ potentially supporting lawsuits *against* state bans on gender-affirming care rather than supporting them. Under a new administration, federal attorneys might file statements of interest or amicus briefs in ongoing litigation to argue that these state bans (and by extension Trumpâ€™s policy) infringe on constitutional rights (such as equal protection or parental rights in medical decision-making) and conflict with federal protections. **Third**, federal agencies can restore funding streams: for instance, NIH could prioritize grants into gender dysphoria treatment and outcomes research, SAMHSA could fund mental health support programs specifically for trans youth, and any federal training or conference bans around trans health topics instituted under Trump could be lifted. Ensuring that Title X clinics (family planning clinics) and community health centers understand they *can* provide gender-affirming care with federal funds will bring services back. HHS might even create incentives, like a grant program for clinics to expand services for trans youth to make up for lost time. **Fourth**, a new administration should work to repair trust and damage: issuing public health campaigns or guidance to pediatricians nationwide, reaffirming the medical consensus that gender-affirming care is legitimate and lifesaving for some youth, thereby pushing back against misinformation. They could also directly engage trans youth and their families â€“ maybe a White House listening session or task force on transgender youth wellbeing, signaling these young people are valued and policy will be guided by their needs and expert input, not ideology. **Fifth**, while much can be done by executive action, some issues may need legislative fixes or at least shielding: pushing for passage of laws like the Equality Act (which would include gender identity under civil rights law nationwide) would create a robust legal framework that future administrations canâ€™t easily undermine. Specifically related to healthcare, Congress could consider updating laws to protect the right to gender-affirming care (though given the divisiveness, that might be challenging). If the Supreme Court hasnâ€™t yet weighed in definitively, a new adminâ€™s DOJ could carefully pick cases to support that might establish a precedent that trans healthcare bans violate federal law or the Constitution, thereby insulating against future executive changes. On the ground, **rebuilding capacity** is critical: some specialists might have left or scaled back due to the ban; the government could fund training fellowships for new providers in transgender health to ensure there are enough professionals to meet demand once access is restored. And crucially, support systems for trans youth need bolstering â€“ the new HHS could expand suicide prevention and counseling initiatives and partner with schools to ensure trans students know the government now supports them rather than targets them. Undoing the harm will also require **public messaging**: the President and leading officials should speak out about respecting and loving transgender youth, to counteract years of demonization. By swiftly rescinding the ban, reinstating funding, legally protecting care, and actively promoting acceptance, a future administration can not only roll back Trumpâ€™s EO 14170 but hopefully usher in a safer, more affirming era for transgender children where their healthcare is treated as a private medical matter â€“ as it should be â€“ and not a political football.  

## Executive Order 14171 â€“ **Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œThe Bureaucratic Purge Orderâ€* â€“ In the eyes of progressives, this EO is basically Trumpâ€™s **â€œloyalty over competenceâ€ scheme**, enabling him to fire nonpartisan civil servants en masse and replace them with cronies, thus politicizing the professional workforce and gutting government expertise.  

**What it Does:** EO 14171 resurrects and expands Trumpâ€™s prior efforts (like his first-term â€œSchedule Fâ€) to reclassify tens of thousands of federal civil service jobs in a way that **strips them of traditional merit-system protections ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Creates New Federal Employee Category to Enhance Accountability â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/#:~:text=,swiftly%20remove%20employees%20in%20policy))**. Specifically, it creates a new category of federal employees â€“ essentially all career officials in â€œpolicy-making, policy-influencing, or confidentialâ€ positions â€“ who can be hired and fired at will, **without the due process rights that most civil servants have** ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Creates New Federal Employee Category to Enhance Accountability â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/#:~:text=policy,misconduct%2C%20corruption%2C%20or%20subversion%20of)). Under this order, agencies are instructed to identify roles (potentially up to ~50,000 positions across government) that have significant policy influence â€“ including lawyers, regulators, economists, scientists, managers, etc. â€“ and convert those roles to the new excepted service schedule (often dubbed â€œSchedule Fâ€ informally). Once converted, individuals in those roles **could be terminated or replaced without the lengthy notice and appeals process normally required** ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Creates New Federal Employee Category to Enhance Accountability â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/#:~:text=policy,misconduct%2C%20corruption%2C%20or%20subversion%20of)). The practical effect is that the President (through his agency heads) could **sweep out career staff deemed disloyal or obstructive to his agenda** almost overnight ([If Trump Is Reelected, His Aides Are Planning to Purge the Civil Service - Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/07/trump-reelected-aides-plan-purge-civil-service/374842/#:~:text=the%2011th%20hour%20of%20his,rest%20to%20fall%20in%20line)). It also means new hires for those positions wouldnâ€™t have to go through the competitive exam or vetting processes of the merit system â€“ they could be **direct political appointees or hires based on loyalty tests** rather than qualifications. EO 14171 likely instructs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to implement this reclassification promptly, overturning the safeguards put in place by Biden (who had reversed Trumpâ€™s earlier Schedule F on Day One of his term). It frames this as an â€œaccountabilityâ€ measure â€“ implying current civil service rules allow poor performers or â€œsaboteursâ€ to remain employed. It also **blocks avenues of appeal**: normally a fired fed can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) for wrongful termination; those rights would not extend to the new Schedule F employees, leaving them with virtually no recourse if fired for, say, disagreeing with a policy or producing analysis unfavorable to the administrationâ€™s views. Furthermore, by classifying them as â€œcareerâ€ still (though without protections), it blurs lines: these employees are no longer neutral technocrats; they serve at the Presidentâ€™s pleasure just like political appointees do, but they sit in roles deep within agencies that typically would outlast one administration. In essence, EO 14171 **turns a huge swath of the federal workforce into de facto political employees**, enabling a purge and replacement that reaches beyond the usual top-tier appointed positions down into the bureaucracyâ€™s mid-level and expert ranks.  

**Claimed Purpose:** The Trump administration claimed this order was necessary to **â€œdrain the swampâ€ of unaccountable bureaucrats and ensure the Presidentâ€™s policies are faithfully executed** ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Creates New Federal Employee Category to Enhance Accountability â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/#:~:text=,ultimately%20be%20moved%20into%20Schedule)). They argue that many career officials hold ideological biases or are slow-rolling the Presidentâ€™s agenda, and because itâ€™s too hard to fire federal employees under existing rules (which require cause and lengthy processes), these â€œbad applesâ€ stay in place and undermine elected leadership ([If Trump Is Reelected, His Aides Are Planning to Purge the Civil Service - Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/07/trump-reelected-aides-plan-purge-civil-service/374842/#:~:text=The%20plan%2C%20as%20detailed%20to,%E2%80%9Cchilling%20effect%E2%80%9D%20will%20cause%20the)). By creating this new classification, Trump asserts he can remove poor performers, insubordinates, or what he terms members of the â€œdeep stateâ€ who put their own agendas above the public interest ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Creates New Federal Employee Category to Enhance Accountability â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/#:~:text=cumbersome%20adverse%20action%20procedures%20or,remain%20career%20positions%2C%20filled%20through)). The EOâ€™s justification draws on examples of notoriously cumbersome disciplinary processes or instances where civil servants resisted unethical orders (which Trump frames as disloyalty or insubordination). The language of â€œaccountabilityâ€ and â€œefficiencyâ€ features prominently: they claim this will cut through red tape and allow agencies to **â€œswiftly remove employees in policy roles for poor performance, misconduct, or subversion of Presidential directivesâ€ ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Creates New Federal Employee Category to Enhance Accountability â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/#:~:text=,President%2C%20but%20must%20faithfully%20implement))**. Essentially, they sell it as aligning the bureaucracy with the mandate of the elected President â€“ contending that itâ€™s anti-democratic for unelected officials to thwart or delay policies set by the President. Thereâ€™s also rhetoric about removing those who â€œput their own interests ahead of the American peopleâ€™sâ€ ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Creates New Federal Employee Category to Enhance Accountability â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-creates-new-federal-employee-category-to-enhance-accountability/#:~:text=FIXING%20A%20BROKEN%20SYSTEM%3A%20The,ahead%20of%20the%20American%20people%E2%80%99s)), insinuating that existing career staff care more about maintaining their power or their preferred policies than executing the Presidentâ€™s. Additionally, they suggest this will allow injecting fresh talent into government â€“ implying many current staff are mediocre â€œdead weightâ€ protected by a broken system. In sum, the official line is that EO 14171 will **restore accountability and effectiveness by making federal employees directly answerable (via their job security) to the President** and by removing obstacles to firing those who arenâ€™t performing or who oppose the administrationâ€™s policy direction. Itâ€™s pitched as a modernization, bringing â€œmeritâ€ back â€“ ironically by removing merit-based safeguards â€“ and as a way to make government more responsive to the votersâ€™ elected leadership rather than a permanent class of bureaucrats.  

**Whatâ€™s Really Happening:** This order is a thinly veiled plan to **enable a politicized purge of the civil service and intimidate those who remain into compliance**, fundamentally undermining the non-partisan expertise that federal agencies rely on ([If Trump Is Reelected, His Aides Are Planning to Purge the Civil Service - Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/07/trump-reelected-aides-plan-purge-civil-service/374842/#:~:text=the%2011th%20hour%20of%20his,rest%20to%20fall%20in%20line)). In reality, the existing civil service system already allows removal of employees for misconduct or poor performance â€“ itâ€™s deliberate (to protect against patronage and politically motivated firings) but not impossible. The narrative of a vast â€œdeep stateâ€ conspiracy is largely a myth; most career officials are just doing their jobs following law and evidence. What Trump likely really wants is the power to **remove anyone who isnâ€™t personally loyal or who voices inconvenient truths** â€“ for example, an economist whose analysis shows a Trump policy is failing, or a climate scientist whose data contradicts administration claims, or an attorney who refuses to legally defend a dubious action. Under EO 14171, those people could be sacked overnight, sending a chilling message to others. It converts a professional civil service that has served presidents of both parties into something more akin to spoils system employees â€“ only those pledging loyalty to Trumpâ€™s agenda (and perhaps to Trump himself) would feel secure. This is hugely damaging to government functionality: expertise might be replaced with sycophancy. Imagine environmental regulations being crafted not by experienced scientists and lawyers but by political appointees and hires whose main qualification is fealty. Itâ€™s a **recipe for corruption and incompetence**. The EOâ€™s real aim is power consolidation: by controlling the bureaucracy, Trump can act with fewer internal checks. During his first term, many of the guardrails that prevented worse outcomes were experienced civil servants raising concerns, slowing processes, or refusing unlawful orders. EO 14171 seeks to remove those guardrails. It also is likely to demoralize and drive out many talented civil servants â€“ who would want to serve under a president who might fire them for simply doing their job objectively? That brain drain would be long-lasting. Moreover, Trump loyalists installed in those positions might push through extreme or legally dubious policies quickly, knowing they wonâ€™t push back â€“ so policies could become more radical and less vetted. Government decisions could also swing wildly with each election since the stable layer of experts is eroded; it undermines continuity and institutional memory. And although pitched as targeting â€œpolicymakers,â€ the line can be blurred: even scientists or technical experts could be deemed policy-influencing if their work informs policy. The new category could sweep broadly, capturing, say, an FDA expert who approves vaccines or a DOJ antitrust lawyer â€“ and those people shouldnâ€™t be subjected to partisan whims. Essentially, **Trump is rewriting the rules to ensure the bureaucracy serves him, not the public interest**, turning civil servants into at-will employees who must cater to political directives even if unethical or factually unfounded, or else risk instant termination. Thatâ€™s a dramatic shift away from a centuryâ€™s practice of building a merit-based, politically neutral civil service. Itâ€™s a power grab with potentially disastrous consequences for governance, making government more about loyalty than law or facts.  

**Broader Agenda Fit:** EO 14171 fits perfectly into Trumpâ€™s authoritarian-leaning agenda and his vendetta against what he calls the â€œdeep state.â€ Itâ€™s the structural mechanism by which he can implement other controversial policies without resistance â€“ in that sense, itâ€™s a force multiplier for all his other objectives (be it harsher immigration crackdowns, legally dubious national security moves, etc., which in first term were often slowed or moderated by internal dissent). It aligns with his pattern of demanding personal loyalty (we saw this in how he treated FBI Comey, Attorney General Sessions, etc.) but extends it to the permanent bureaucracy. Ideologically, it resonates with the far-rightâ€™s view (championed by groups like Heritageâ€™s Project 2025) that the administrative state is an unelected bastion of liberalism that needs to be broken. Indeed, heritage and other think tanks have explicitly mapped out plans to purge civil servants and install loyalists; EO 14171 is the execution of that philosophy. It also ties into his broader strategy of consolidating executive power at the expense of checks and balances: by taming the bureaucracy, heâ€™s weakening an informal check (the expertise and ethics of career staff) and enhancing the unitary executive notion that the President controls the entire executive branch absolutely. Politically, itâ€™s red meat to his base that hates â€œbureaucratsâ€ and cheered his confrontations with agencies (like his feud with parts of DOJ/FBI and the intelligence community). Itâ€™s essentially a promise that â€œnext time, I wonâ€™t be constrained by insiders â€“ Iâ€™ll clear them out and fully implement the agenda.â€ This appeals to those frustrated that Trump didnâ€™t fully â€œbuild the wallâ€ or achieve some other extreme promises; he can blame disloyal bureaucrats and say this EO fixes that. It also dovetails with his attacks on institutions that challenge him â€“ media, courts (though harder to purge), independent agencies, etc. Itâ€™s part of turning the federal government into an instrument of his personal will and ideology. Also, by staffing policy roles with ideologues, this helps ensure even if he leaves office, the people installed could try to burrow in or at least leave a lasting impact, having set policies in motion. So itâ€™s about long-term ideological transformation of the government workforce â€“ making it more conservative and Trump-aligned in outlook, which could have effects beyond his term (as traditionally, some political appointees convert to career status if allowed â€“ although in this scheme, maybe all are at-will anyway). For allies in Congress who often clash with agencies (like EPA or IRS), this is a dream scenario â€“ a chance to hamstring agencies from within. In summary, the EO is a keystone for Trumpâ€™s second term agenda: **itâ€™s how he ensures implementation of the rest of his agenda without internal opposition**, thus itâ€™s absolutely central to fulfilling his vision of a presidency unencumbered by institutional norms or dissent.  

**Harm Caused:** The immediate harm of this order is to the **integrity and capacity of the federal government**. If implemented, weâ€™d likely see a wave of firings â€“ thousands of experienced civil servants shown the door, not for misconduct, but for perceived lack of loyalty or mere association with previous administrationsâ€™ policies ([If Trump Is Reelected, His Aides Are Planning to Purge the Civil Service - Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/07/trump-reelected-aides-plan-purge-civil-service/374842/#:~:text=the%2011th%20hour%20of%20his,rest%20to%20fall%20in%20line)). This means agencies from EPA to Treasury to Defense could lose institutional knowledge and technical expertise crucial for policy-making and crisis response. For example, during a pandemic or financial crisis, you want seasoned experts guiding the response; firing them en masse leaves a vacuum or, worse, fills it with unqualified individuals. So, the **government becomes less effective and more error-prone**. We could see poorly designed regulations (because the knowledgeable people are gone), legal blunders (because veteran lawyers who spot issues are replaced with yes-men), and botched implementation of complex programs like Medicare or air traffic control modernization. Another harm is **rampant favoritism and corruption**: once protections are gone, positions can be awarded as patronage to political supporters or even family/friends, rather than merit. This can lead to incompetence (jobs done poorly by unqualified people) and corruption (imagine procurement officials who are political appointees favoring cronies for contracts). The morale among remaining career staff would plummet â€“ knowing they serve at a presidentâ€™s pleasure, many might either try to curry favor rather than give honest advice, or theyâ€™ll leave for more stable private or state jobs. Recruitment of new talent would suffer as the civil service is seen as unstable and politicized; high-caliber professionals might avoid federal jobs, resulting in a brain drain and difficulty attracting the next generation of scientists, analysts, etc. Another harm is to **continuity of government**: one reason for a neutral civil service is to ensure that when leadership changes, the machine keeps running (e.g., Social Security checks go out, disaster response happens regardless of politics). If huge swaths are politicized, a change of administration could cause massive turnover and disruption â€“ think of a scenario where each incoming president replaces not just 4,000 appointees (as now) but tens of thousands of quasi-appointees; government could grind to a halt every four or eight years with chaos and gaps in service. In terms of democracy and rule of law, this order undermines them: **agencies might become echo chambers** where only the presidentâ€™s view is allowed, leading to more extreme and potentially unlawful policy decisions since there are no internal brakes. This raises the risk of more court invalidations (if thereâ€™s anyone left to sue or laws left to enforce) and constitutional crises when agencies perhaps do things at a presidentâ€™s behest that they normally would refuse (like targeting political opponents or skewing data). Furthermore, communities that rely on federal programs (farmers, veterans, low-income families) could see decline in program quality as expertise is lost and politicization seeps into even service delivery (imagine if red tape is cut for politically favored groups but increased for others). The harm also includes **making civil service a battleground** â€“ workers might be chosen for loyalty to one party, and then purged when the other party comes in, so it becomes a spoils system. This could deeply entrench partisan divides and make the idea of impartial public service a thing of the past, altering the fabric of governance in America. Individual livelihoods are also at stake: career officials whoâ€™ve dedicated their lives to service could be summarily fired (and possibly blacklisted for future federal employment), losing their income and careers unjustly â€“ thatâ€™s a personal tragedy for many and a signal to young people that government service is precarious. Overall, EO 14171 threatens to **make the federal government both less accountable (ironically) to facts and law, and more susceptible to authoritarian control**, which harms not just the employees but the American public who rely on a well-functioning government to protect their health, safety, and welfare.  

**How a Future Administration Could Undo It:** If a future administration is elected that values a non-partisan civil service, its first act should be to **revoke EO 14171 immediately** and halt any ongoing reclassification of positions. President Biden actually did this in Jan 2021 for Trumpâ€™s original Schedule F order; similarly, a post-Trump president must act on Day One to cancel the authority for the new excepted service schedule and restore prior civil service rules ([If Trump Is Reelected, His Aides Are Planning to Purge the Civil Service - Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/07/trump-reelected-aides-plan-purge-civil-service/374842/#:~:text=The%20plan%2C%20as%20detailed%20to,%E2%80%9Cchilling%20effect%E2%80%9D%20will%20cause%20the)). OPM can be instructed to **cancel any regulations or guidance** issued to implement the Schedule F-type system and to convert any affected employees back to their original competitive service status (if Trump had already fired them, ideally rehire where possible, though practically some may be lost). The Merit Systems Protection Board and Office of Special Counsel (which protects whistleblowers) should be revitalized and signaled to actively shield employees from any lingering retaliation and to adjudicate any appeals from improper firings during the Trump purge period. There might be a need for triage: identifying critical positions that were vacated and fast-track hiring competent replacements, maybe inviting fired experts back into service (some may return if asked under new leadership). The new administration should also work with Congress to **prevent this from happening again**. Congress could codify limits on excepted service expansion â€“ e.g., explicitly carve out that certain positions must remain in the competitive service or that mass reclassifications cannot be done without legislative approval. Bipartisan civil service reform legislation might shore up protections, perhaps modernizing the firing process modestly (to take away the claimed need for Schedule F) but unequivocally prohibiting a president from creating a broad category like this by himself. Another key piece is **cultural and institutional repair**. The new President and cabinet must strongly affirm the value of career civil servants, encourage open debate and dissenting advice within agencies, and commit not to retaliate against employees for good faith disagreements or whistleblowing. They might reverse Trumpâ€™s loyalty litmus tests by, for example, issuing guidance that hiring will be based strictly on merit and that political affiliation is not to be considered (reaffirming existing law, actually). Training for political appointees on how to work with career staff respectfully could help. The administration should also consider re-empowering agency scientific integrity policies and similar measures so staff feel protected when speaking honestly about data or analysis (Biden did some of this via memo). To address any damage done, maybe reconstitute units that were dismantled under the purge (e.g., if a climate science team was gutted, rebuild it). In some cases, commissions or task forces might be set up to examine decisions made during the fully-politicized period â€“ were there regulations or contracts approved by unqualified appointees that need revisiting for legality or effectiveness? They may need to unwind harmful policies that slipped through without expert input. On a more symbolic level, a future president could meet with groups of career employees from various agencies to thank them and reassure them of job stability moving forward, trying to boost morale. Further, robust enforcement of the Whistleblower Protection Act and maybe seeking enhancements to it (like easier restitution for those fired unjustly under Schedule F) would be important to encourage employees to come forward if something is wrong, without fear. If some employees were unfairly fired under Trumpâ€™s order and not reinstated, perhaps a special hiring authority could give them priority to return to federal service. Essentially, undoing EO 14171 is not only about flipping a switch back, but also **rebuilding trust and capacity**. The civil service system might need reforms (some argue itâ€™s too hard to remove genuinely bad performers), but those should be done thoughtfully with bipartisan support, not via a stealthy coup. A new administration should engage Congress, unions, and experts to discuss any genuine tweaks (like improving training or performance management) that strengthen civil service while keeping protections â€“ this could take the wind out of arguments for drastic moves like Schedule F in the future. By swiftly repealing Trumpâ€™s order and taking these supportive actions, a future administration can help ensure the federal workforce remains a steady, professional backbone of our democracy, rather than a tool of one manâ€™s personal rule.  

## Executive Order 14172 â€“ **Ending Illegal DEI and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œThe Whitewashing Federal Workforce Orderâ€* â€“ Critics slam this as an **attack on diversity and inclusion** that rolls back progress and entrenches discrimination under the false flag of â€œmeritâ€.  

**What it Does:** EO 14172 abolishes and prohibits diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the federal government and its contractors, dramatically reshaping hiring, training, and procurement policies to be â€œcolorblindâ€ â€“ which in practice means ignoring systemic disparities ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei/#:~:text=,Order%2011246%20contracting%20criteria%20mandating)). Concretely, the order **terminates any DEI programs in federal agencies**, such as employee affinity groups, unconscious bias trainings, or equity action plans that were implemented under Biden ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei/#:~:text=PROTECTING%20CIVIL%20RIGHTS%20AND%20EXPANDING,civil%20rights%20measure%20in%20decades)). It likely rescinds Bidenâ€™s executive orders on diversity and equity (like EO 13985 which Trump already revoked, and EO 14035 which promoted DEI in the federal workforce). It bars agencies from considering factors like race or gender in hiring or promotion decisions beyond bare compliance with nondiscrimination laws â€“ eliminating things like targeted recruitment at minority-serving institutions or development programs for underrepresented groups ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei/#:~:text=,Order%2011246%20contracting%20criteria%20mandating)). In federal contracting, EO 14172 **strips away affirmative action requirements and any kind of supplier diversity goals** ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei/#:~:text=,strong%20action%20to%20end%20private)). Specifically, it revokes components of Executive Order 11246 (which since the 1960s has required federal contractors to have affirmative action plans for women and minorities) ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei/#:~:text=,strong%20action%20to%20end%20private)). It instructs agencies that contractor selection and subcontracting cannot give any weight to a companyâ€™s diversity performance or commitments. It also stops OFCCP (the office that enforces contractor nondiscrimination) from pressuring contractors to have workforce diversity that reflects labor pools ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei/#:~:text=,discrimination%2C%20including%20civil%20compliance%20investigations)) â€“ effectively neutering enforcement beyond blatant discrimination cases. For private sector, the EO tasks agencies to **root out â€œillegal DEIâ€ in companies they regulate or interact with** ([Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI â€“ The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei/#:~:text=sexual%20preference%2C%20or%20religion.%20,Harvard)): for example, perhaps telling the EEOC to scrutinize corporate diversity initiatives for reverse discrimination. It mandates that **any training or policy that could be seen as suggesting preference or blame based on race/gender be eliminated**, echoing Trumpâ€™s 2020 ban on â€œdivisive conceptsâ€ training. In its place, it enshrines a concept of strict meritocracy: hiring and promotion decisions should be based solely on individual credentials with no regard for group identity (ignoring how bias can affect those credentials). The order might require agencies to review their workforce demographics and recruitment to ensure no â€œquotasâ€ or â€œgoalsâ€ exist for diversity. It likely also instructs OPM to revise rules to forbid any sort of DEI statements in hiring or performance reviews. The net effect is## Executive Order 14172 â€“ **Ending Illegal DEI and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity**  
**Derisive Nickname:** *â€œThe Whitewashing Federal Workforce Orderâ€* â€“ This directive is pilloried by progressives as an outright **assault on diversity and inclusion**, effectively whitewashing the federal workforce and contracting processes under the pretense of â€œmerit.â€  

**What it Does:** EO 14172 abolishes virtually all Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts within the federal government and its contractors, mandating a so-called â€œcolorblind meritocracyâ€ that in practice **shuts down programs aimed at leveling the playing field for marginalized groups**. It terminates agency DEI offices and cancels initiatives like unconscious bias trainings, minority mentorship programs, or recruitment partnerships with HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions. Any consideration of race, gender, or other underrepresented status in hiring or promotion â€“ even as a soft factor to encourage diversity â€“ is forbidden. Federal hiring and promotions must ignore group identity entirely, with the order implying that previous diversity efforts were â€œillegal discrimination.â€ In federal contracting, the EO **revokes affirmative action requirements and diversity benchmarks**: it rescinds long-standing rules (dating back to Executive Order 11246 from the 1960s) that required federal contractors to set goals for minority and female employment. Agencies can no longer give an edge to, say, a women-owned small business or require contractors to have DEI plans â€“ those practices are now barred as â€œpreferencing.â€ The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is directed to stop pushing contractors on workforce composition, essentially gutting enforcement beyond catching overt intentional discrimination. The order even goes further to **attack private sector DEI**: it instructs federal agencies to â€œtake strong actionâ€ against â€œillegal DEIâ€ in the private sector. While vague, this opens the door for agencies like the EEOC or Labor Department to scrutinize corporate diversity programs for any hint of â€œreverse discrimination.â€ Companies that voluntarily set diversity hiring goals, or that run training on systemic racism or privilege, could find themselves subject to federal investigation or legal challenges under this EOâ€™s philosophy. In sum, EO 14172 doesnâ€™t just neutralize DEI â€“ it **weaponizes the government against it**. All federal personnel policies must now be strictly â€œidentity blind,â€ and any attempt to acknowledge or address inequities is treated as suspect or unlawful. Where the Biden administration had required agencies to assess and advance equity in their programs, Trumpâ€™s order flatly cancels those assessments. The â€œrestoring meritâ€ language is code for **reverting to status quo practices** that ignore the cumulative effects of bias, effectively disbanding mechanisms designed to foster a more inclusive federal workplace and supplier base.  

**Claimed Purpose:** Trumpâ€™s justification is wrapped in the rhetoric of **civil rights and fairness, turned upside down**. The administration claims that DEI programs had themselves become discriminatory â€“ that by taking race, gender, or ethnicity into account, these initiatives were giving â€œpreferential treatmentâ€ and violating the principle of equal opportunity. They cite the Supreme Courtâ€™s recent decision ending affirmative action in college admissions and assert that the federal government must likewise â€œnot discriminateâ€ by using any identity-based considerations. The order is sold as a way to *â€œprotect the civil rights of all Americansâ€* by enforcing **colorblind, gender-blind policies**. Trump argues that merit and individual qualifications should be the sole yardstick, and that DEI had undermined this by imposing what he calls â€œradical â€¦ preferencingâ€. In their narrative, things like diversity hiring goals or implicit bias trainings are portrayed as illegal quota systems or â€œwokeâ€ indoctrination that demean merit and divide employees. The claimed intent is to **expand individual opportunity by ensuring everyone competes on equal footing**, without any â€œartificialâ€ advantages or disadvantages tied to demographic group. They also pitch it as enhancing efficiency: no more â€œwastefulâ€ diversity trainings or bureaucratic equity offices â€“ just pure focus on mission and talent. The fact sheet for this order even frames it as *â€œthe most important federal civil rights measure in decadesâ€*, perversely equating the elimination of diversity efforts with the advancement of civil rights. Trumpâ€™s team insist that a truly fair government is one that is blind to race or gender, and they claim DEI had become a â€œdivisiveâ€ force that violated the Constitutionâ€™s promise of equality. In short, the administration presents EO 14172 as **a restoration of fairness and constitutional colorblindness**, contending that it ends â€œillegal discriminationâ€ in the guise of DEI and returns the federal government to a pure merit-based system where, supposedly, the best person wins regardless of background.  

**Whatâ€™s Really Happening:** In reality, this order **dismantles tools that addressed persistent inequalities, effectively locking in the status quo biases as â€˜meritâ€™**. Trumpâ€™s â€œmerit-basedâ€ mantra ignores decades of evidence that without proactive diversity efforts, hiring and promotion often reflect unconscious bias and old boysâ€™ networks. By scrapping DEI, the EO leaves federal agencies and contractors with no mandate to even examine whether their practices privilege certain groups over others. The result will almost certainly be *decreased* opportunities for women, minorities, and other underrepresented communities. For example, eliminating outreach programs and internship pipelines for disadvantaged groups means fewer such applicants make it into the hiring pool. Banning any consideration of diversity in hiring could mean a qualified Black or Latino candidate who might have gotten a slight edge under prior diversity-friendly policy now gets no such look â€“ and if subtle biases are at play, they could be overlooked entirely. The order pretends that the playing field is already level and any intervention is skewing it, when in fact **the playing field is uneven due to systemic factors**. Also, by revoking affirmative action in contracting, it likely reduces the share of federal business going to minority-owned and women-owned firms; larger, well-connected (often white maleâ€“led) companies will have an even easier time dominating contracts without programs that encouraged diversifying the supplier base. EO 14172â€™s directive to crack down on â€œillegal DEIâ€ in the private sector is another dangerous aspect. It serves as a green light for reactionaries to challenge corporate diversity programs â€“ we can expect an uptick in lawsuits and complaints by those claiming â€œreverse discriminationâ€ because a company set diversity hiring goals or had an employee resource group for, say, Black employees. Essentially, Trump is taking the culture war into every HR department in America, which will **scare many companies into retreating from voluntary inclusion efforts**. The purported alignment with the Supreme Courtâ€™s affirmative action ban is a stretch â€“ that case was about college admissions, not employment â€“ but Trump is aggressively extending its logic to employment and contracting. Whatâ€™s really happening is a broad **rollback of civil rights progress**: DEI initiatives, born out of past Republican and Democratic administrationsâ€™ recognition of workplace inequalities, are being trashed. This doesnâ€™t create a bias-free utopia; it more likely means biases go unchecked and unaddressed. The â€œmeritâ€ that Trump heralds often has hidden inputs â€“ who had access to good education, who was mentored, who feels welcome in a workplace â€“ all things DEI seeks to influence. Removing DEI doesnâ€™t remove those inputs; it just forbids anyone from talking about or mitigating them. The orderâ€™s Orwellian framing tries to equate diversity efforts with discrimination, when in fact those efforts were aimed at *counteracting* discrimination. By halting unconscious bias training, for instance, the EO implies that acknowledging implicit bias was wrong â€“ thus managers may feel thereâ€™s no problem with their current perceptions, even if those perceptions are skewed. In short, EO 14172 is *not* making things fair; itâ€™s **ensuring that existing inequities are ignored and likely exacerbated**. It turns back the clock on inclusive hiring, promotion, and contracting practices, making the federal governmentâ€™s workforce and its contractors more homogenous and less reflective of America. And despite the language about individual rights, individuals from marginalized groups will undoubtedly feel their rights to equal opportunity diminished, as the system stops trying to accommodate or uplift them.  

**Broader Agenda Fit:** This order is a centerpiece of Trumpâ€™s broader crusade against â€œwokenessâ€ and the post-2020 racial reckoning. It aligns seamlessly with his other second-term moves like banning discussions of systemic racism in schools (EO 14169) and erasing protections for transgender people (EO 14168). All these efforts share a common theme: **reasserting a conservative vision of society by sweeping away acknowledgement of inequality**. EO 14172, in particular, was a long-standing goal of the right. It picks up where Trumpâ€™s 2020 order (that banned â€œdivisive conceptsâ€ training in federal agencies) left off, but goes even further by targeting hiring and contracting policies. It also rides the momentum of the Supreme Courtâ€™s affirmative action decision (Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, 2023) â€“ conservatives have openly planned to extend that decisionâ€™s logic to employment, and Trump is doing just that via executive fiat. The order fits into the GOPâ€™s decades-long backlash against affirmative action and diversity initiatives, framing them as â€œreverse racism.â€ By implementing this federally, Trump not only pleases his base that reviles â€œidentity politics,â€ but he also pressures corporate America (which had been, in many cases, moving toward more robust DEI programs) to abandon those efforts or face conservative wrath. Culturally and politically, itâ€™s red meat to those who believe the focus on diversity in recent years has gone too far. It reinforces the narrative that Trump will smash â€œPC cultureâ€ and restore a supposed lost meritocratic ideal. This of course dovetails with his appeals to white grievance: many of his supporters feel threatened by diversity initiatives (seeing them as favoritism toward minorities at their expense), and Trump is validating those feelings by eliminating such programs in government and discouraging them elsewhere. Additionally, by eliminating DEI personnel and programs, heâ€™s likely eliminating positions often filled by progressive-minded individuals within the bureaucracy â€“ dovetailing with his Schedule F plan (EO 14171) to purge the civil service. Indeed, DEI officers and program managers might have been among the first on the chopping block; their roles are now moot. So this order helps **ideologically cleanse the federal workforce**, bending it toward Trumpâ€™s preferences. It is also a signal to allied politicians at state and local levels: just as some states have passed â€œanti-wokeâ€ laws, Trump is doing it at the federal level, giving momentum to that agenda nationally. Internationally, it puts the U.S. government at odds with many global companies and allies that value diversity efforts â€“ but Trumpâ€™s agenda is unapologetically nationalist and inward-focused, so heâ€™s unconcerned about that friction. In summary, EO 14172 is a linchpin of Trumpâ€™s second-term identity politics: itâ€™s how he aims to **stamp out institutional support for diversity and cement a hard-right vision of â€œequalityâ€ that ignores inequality**, thereby reshaping the federal governmentâ€™s culture to mirror the grievances and denialism that animate his movement.  

**Harm Caused:** The harms from this order will be felt both within the government and across society. Inside the federal workforce, **employees from underrepresented groups immediately lose resources and support systems** that helped them navigate a historically white- and male-dominated institution. Mentorship programs for women in STEM at federal agencies? Gone. Networking groups for Black or LGBTQ employees? Likely disbanded. This can exacerbate feelings of isolation and marginalization among those employees. Without DEI training or emphasis, subtle biases in hiring and promotion may go unchecked â€“ leading over time to **decreased diversity at senior levels and in hiring cohorts**. We could see a stall or reversal in the gradual gains made in diversifying the federal workforce. For instance, if agencies no longer do targeted recruiting at minority-focused job fairs, their applicant pools will skew towards traditionally represented demographics. This not only harms qualified individuals who miss opportunities, but also harms the agencies by depriving them of a diverse talent pool. Numerous studies show diverse teams make better decisions; by making diversity a non-goal, the government risks becoming more monolithic in thinking and approach, which can reduce innovation in problem-solving. Morale among employees of color, women, and other minorities is likely to drop â€“ the message they receive is that their employer **doesnâ€™t value efforts to include or understand them**. Some may leave, leading to brain drain and turnover costs. Meanwhile, historically advantaged groups might feel vindicated, possibly breeding a less inclusive workplace culture (e.g. people might be more vocal with insensitive remarks now that â€œwokenessâ€ is officially scorned). The elimination of bias training and related initiatives could also result in **more workplace discrimination or harassment** incidents, as employees (and managers) are no longer educated about implicit biases or respectful communication across differences. Outside the government, the effects ripple into the contractor community and beyond. Federal contractors, who employ millions, may dial back their own affirmative action and diversity efforts since theyâ€™re no longer required and could even be seen as liabilities. That could mean **fewer job opportunities for minorities and women in the private sector**, especially in industries tied heavily to federal contracts (construction, defense, IT, etc.). Minority-owned businesses could lose business; previously they got a boost from federal subcontracting goals and set-asides â€“ those are likely scrapped, making it harder for them to compete with established firms that have more resources. This can widen economic disparities. Additionally, Trumpâ€™s stance may embolden opponents of DEI in the corporate world to challenge companiesâ€™ internal policies. We might see an uptick in lawsuits by employees (or even opportunistic litigants) claiming that DEI initiatives constitute discrimination â€“ for example, a white male employee suing because his company set diversity hiring targets and he perceives that as hurting his promotion chances. Even if such suits donâ€™t ultimately prevail (courts have long held that moderate affirmative efforts are lawful in employment), the litigation and fear can cause companies to preemptively scale back scholarships for underrepresented students, leadership development programs for women, or similar efforts â€“ **chilling beneficial programs nationwide**. Another harm is to public trust and service equity: Bidenâ€™s equity EO had pushed agencies to examine how their services serve all populations (like ensuring disaster aid reaches communities of color as effectively as white communities). Trumpâ€™s order halts those reviews, which means **existing inequities in government service delivery remain unaddressed**. The communities that have historically been underserved by federal programs â€“ often minorities and rural poor â€“ will see less attention to fixing those gaps, effectively perpetuating disparities in outcomes (health, education, economic opportunity). For instance, if the USDA under Biden was looking at expanding credit access for Black farmers and that gets canceled, those farmers remain at a disadvantage. The harm also includes confusion and turmoil within agencies as they abruptly reverse course â€“ programs mid-implementation are canceled, staff working on DEI might be reassigned or let go, and managers have to rewrite policies and handbooks. This disruption can hamper productivity and focus in the short term. Finally, the message this EO sends â€“ that diversity efforts are not just unnecessary but â€œillegalâ€ â€“ **devalues the identity and experiences of federal employees and citizens who are women, minorities, disabled, LGBTQ, etc.** It effectively tells them that any unique challenges they face due to their identity are not the governmentâ€™s concern. This can erode trust in the government as an employer and as a guardian of equal rights. Marginalized communities may feel more alienated from a government that openly dismisses initiatives meant to include them. In the long run, reversing decades of diversity progress will be hard to undo; the loss of momentum could mean years before agencies claw back to current levels of inclusion if and when DEI is reinstated. All told, EO 14172 harms not only those it purportedly â€œfreesâ€ (since merit without fairness isnâ€™t genuine freedom) but the very ideal of equal opportunity it professes to champion â€“ it increases the likelihood that **systemic biases go unchallenged, leading to a federal establishment that looks less like America and serves Americans less equitably**.  

**How a Future Administration Could Undo It:** Reversing the damage of EO 14172 would require a robust re-commitment to diversity and equity from day one. The next president can and should **revoke this EO immediately** and reinstate the prior orders and policies that promoted DEI. For instance, President Bidenâ€™s EO 13985 (Advancing Racial Equity) and EO 14035 (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce) â€“ which Trump scrapped â€“ would effectively be reissued or replaced with equivalent directives, reactivating agency equity action plans and employee DEIA initiatives. Concretely, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) should be instructed to **restore diversity hiring programs**: this might include resuming targeted recruitment and internship programs for underrepresented communities, allowing the use of inclusive hiring practices like considering a broad range of educational experiences or reinstating diversity as one of many factors in hiring where appropriate and lawful. Agencies should quickly reestablish or re-empower their internal DEI councils and employee resource groups, making clear these are officially supported again. The new administration must also rebuild training: it can revoke Trumpâ€™s ban on â€œdivisive conceptâ€ training and encourage agencies to provide modern, research-based unconscious bias training and inclusion workshops (ensuring they comply with law, but such training *can* be done in a way consistent with equal protection, focusing on respect and understanding). On the contractor side, steps should be taken to **reinvigorate affirmative action requirements**. Through the Labor Department, a future president could restore the rules that Trump eliminated: e.g., reintroduce the obligation for federal contractors to have affirmative action plans and goals for hiring and promoting qualified women and minorities, and again require them to report on their progress. If Trumpâ€™s order led to any regulatory changes (for example, altering the Federal Acquisition Regulation or OFCCP guidelines), those can be rolled back via new rulemaking or even by emergency interim rules if justified. Likewise, the government can resume using its immense procurement power to encourage supplier diversity, by reviving targets for contracting dollars to go to small businesses owned by women, people of color, veterans, etc. The next administrationâ€™s Department of Justice and EEOC should also send clear signals to the private sector: **responsible DEI efforts are not â€œillegal discrimination.â€** This could involve issuing guidance or amicus briefs in court cases to defend the lawfulness of corporate diversity programs, to counter any chilling effect Trumpâ€™s policy had. For instance, if lawsuits popped up during Trumpâ€™s term challenging corporate DEI, a new DOJ could take the opposite side, arguing that such initiatives, when properly designed, are consistent with Title VII (the federal law against employment discrimination) and are in fact aligned with the nationâ€™s equal opportunity objectives. On the legislative front, while harder, the administration could push for aspects of the **Equality Act** or other legislation that explicitly affirm the permissibility of certain affirmative measures in employment and contracting â€“ essentially writing into law what had been done by EO, to make it more durable. Another important aspect is **repairing trust and focusing on outcomes**: agencies should restart the equity assessments that were stopped, identifying where Trumpâ€™s tenure worsened disparities (for example, did the percentage of women in tech roles drop? Did contracting with minority firms decline?). They should publish those findings and develop concrete strategies to address any regression. Rehiring or recruiting DEI experts may be needed â€“ Trumpâ€™s order likely drove many away or out, so attracting talent back into those roles is key. The new administration might also convene federal employee town halls or listening sessions with diverse staff to demonstrate its commitment and hear their experiences under the Trump rule, using that feedback to target specific improvements (for example, if women felt promotions became even harder, implement a mentoring or sponsorship program). Symbolic but meaningful moves, like re-establishing a high-level Chief Diversity Officer or re-forming the Government-Wide Diversity and Inclusion Task Force, would coordinate these efforts and underscore leadership buy-in. Importantly, undoing the harm also means communicating to all staff â€“ including those skeptical of DEI â€“ *why* these programs are beneficial and not about quotas or bias. A future administration should emphasize that **merit and diversity are complementary**: the goal is to ensure everyone with merit has a fair shot, which wasnâ€™t the case in the absence of these initiatives. Training for managers can highlight that inclusive leadership improves team performance, appealing even to those who embraced Trumpâ€™s merit rhetoric by showing inclusion is a component of true meritocracy. The culture shift back will take time, but leadership example is crucial: diverse appointments in top roles, visible support for inclusive policies, and celebrating successes (like when an agency improves diversity or closes a gap, make it known). Externally, re-launch public-facing programs like the Justice Departmentâ€™s Project Safe Neighborhoods or others with renewed equity components (for instance, ensure DOJâ€™s enforcement includes fighting systemic discrimination cases again, not chasing phantom reverse-discrimination). By taking these actions, a future administration can not only roll back EO 14172 but **accelerate progress forward**: treat the intervening period as a setback to learn from, and then push even more aggressively (within legal bounds) to embed equity in federal operations. Over time, this will help restore a federal culture that prizes both excellence *and* inclusion, and rebuild trust with communities who felt targeted by Trumpâ€™s anti-DEI stance. In essence, the next administration must loudly proclaim that diversity and equity are back on the agenda, align policy and resources accordingly, and strive to make these principles a normalized part of governance so that theyâ€™re harder to uproot in the future.
