# A Progressive Political Policy Platform to Combat Gender-Based Violence and Abuse in the United States (2025)

## Introduction

Gender-based violence (GBV) and abuse remain pervasive and deeply entrenched issues in the United States, affecting millions of individuals across all demographics, with disproportionate impacts on women, girls, LGBTQ+ individuals, and marginalized communities. While significant legislative and policy advances have been made over the past decades, recent federal and state-level developments, as well as executive actions, have threatened to undermine hard-won protections and progress. As a left-leaning political party committed to equality, justice, and dignity for all, we present a comprehensive, evidence-based policy platform to eradicate gender-based violence and abuse. This platform is rooted in global best practices, robust research, and a resolute commitment to human rights and intersectional equity.

## The Scope and Impact of Gender-Based Violence

Gender-based violence encompasses a spectrum of harmful acts directed at individuals based on their gender, including but not limited to domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, harassment (including technology-facilitated GBV), trafficking, and harmful traditional practices. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 4 women and nearly 1 in 10 men have experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime, with higher rates among LGBTQ+ and BIPOC individuals ([CDC, 2022](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs/nisvs-report-2022.pdf)).

The economic cost of intimate partner violence alone exceeds $3.6 trillion over victims’ lifetimes, including medical costs, lost productivity, criminal justice, and other expenses ([CDC, 2022](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs/nisvs-report-2022.pdf)). Beyond statistics, GBV erodes social cohesion, undermines democracy, and perpetuates cycles of poverty and marginalization.

## Current Issues and Challenges

### 1. Legal and Policy Rollbacks

#### Federal Level

The Trump administration, upon returning to office in 2025, issued sweeping executive orders redefining "sex" strictly as male or female based on immutable biological characteristics, effectively erasing federal recognition of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex individuals ([Holland & Knight, 2025](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/03/the-gender-agenda-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity); [European Business Review, 2025](https://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/two-sexes-trump-executive-order-from-gender-dysphoria-controversy-to-gender-stigma/)). These orders have:

- Barred gender marker updates on federal documents.
- Banned transgender women from women’s sports.
- Threatened federal funding for states and organizations with inclusive gender policies.
- Rolled back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in federal agencies.

While a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) blocking some EOs due to “irreparable harm” to transgender individuals ([Holland & Knight, 2025](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/03/the-gender-agenda-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity)), the chilling effect on civil rights is profound.

#### State Level

States have diverged sharply:
- **Progressive states** (e.g., California, New York, Washington) have expanded protections for survivors, including inclusive definitions of gender, robust funding for survivor services, and legal recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals.
- **Conservative states** (e.g., Texas, Florida, Alabama) have enacted or proposed laws restricting gender-affirming care, banning transgender participation in sports, and criminalizing support for LGBTQ+ youth.

This patchwork undermines equal protection and access to justice, particularly for those crossing state lines or requiring federal services.

### 2. Under-Enforcement and Gaps in Implementation

Despite robust federal laws such as the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA), enforcement remains inconsistent. Barriers include:

- Insufficient funding for shelters, legal aid, and culturally competent services.
- Underreporting due to stigma, fear of retaliation, or distrust of law enforcement, especially among immigrants, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+ communities.
- Lack of comprehensive data collection and research, particularly on technology-facilitated GBV and violence against marginalized groups ([ALIGN, 2024](https://www.alignplatform.org/political-parties-responses-technology-facilitated-gbv)).

### 3. Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence (TF-GBV)

The rise of digital platforms has enabled new forms of harassment, stalking, and abuse, disproportionately targeting women in politics, activists, and marginalized groups. Political parties and tech companies have been slow to respond, exacerbating barriers to women’s participation in public life ([ALIGN, 2024](https://www.alignplatform.org/political-parties-responses-technology-facilitated-gbv)).

### 4. Lack of Political Will and International Leadership

The U.S. has failed to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), undermining its global leadership on gender equality. Domestic implementation of international human rights standards remains piecemeal and vulnerable to political shifts ([Gender Policy Report, 2018](https://genderpolicyreport.umn.edu/addressing-gender-based-violence-cedaw-and-political-will/)).

## Policy Proposals: A Progressive Roadmap

### 1. Federal Legislative and Regulatory Reform

#### a. Enshrine Comprehensive, Inclusive Definitions in Federal Law

- Amend VAWA, FVPSA, and related statutes to explicitly include protections for all survivors, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.
- Codify the right to update gender markers on all federal documents, restoring and expanding the “X” marker option for nonbinary, intersex, and gender nonconforming people ([European Business Review, 2025](https://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/two-sexes-trump-executive-order-from-gender-dysphoria-controversy-to-gender-stigma/)).
- Prohibit discrimination in all federally funded programs based on gender identity, sexual orientation, or sex characteristics.

#### b. Restore and Expand DEI Programs

- Repeal executive orders that dismantle DEI initiatives in federal agencies.
- Mandate annual DEI training for all federal employees, contractors, and grantees.
- Tie federal funding to compliance with inclusive, evidence-based anti-violence and anti-discrimination policies.

#### c. Ratify and Implement CEDAW

- Launch a renewed campaign to ratify CEDAW, signaling U.S. commitment to global gender equality.
- Integrate CEDAW principles into domestic law and policy, including regular reporting and accountability mechanisms ([Gender Policy Report, 2018](https://genderpolicyreport.umn.edu/addressing-gender-based-violence-cedaw-and-political-will/)).

### 2. State-Level Action and Model Legislation

#### a. Incentivize State Adoption of Progressive Laws

- Create federal grant programs rewarding states that:
    - Enact inclusive definitions of GBV.
    - Guarantee access to survivor services regardless of immigration status or gender identity.
    - Ban conversion therapy and other harmful practices.
    - Protect access to gender-affirming care and reproductive health services.

#### b. Model State Legislation

- Develop and disseminate model statutes for:
    - Technology-facilitated GBV (TF-GBV), including criminal penalties and civil remedies.
    - Survivor-centered policing and prosecution, with mandatory trauma-informed training for law enforcement and judiciary.
    - Comprehensive sex education and consent curricula in schools.

#### c. Address Patchwork Protections

- Establish federal preemption where state laws undermine basic civil rights and access to GBV protections, particularly for LGBTQ+ individuals and survivors of color.

### 3. Funding and Support for Survivor Services

#### a. Increase Federal and State Funding

- Double federal funding for shelters, transitional housing, legal aid, and culturally competent services, prioritizing underserved and rural areas.
- Expand the Office on Violence Against Women’s grant programs to support innovative, community-led responses, including those addressing intersectional barriers.

#### b. Support for Marginalized Groups

- Fund specialized services for:
    - LGBTQ+ survivors, including safe housing and legal advocacy.
    - Immigrant and refugee survivors, with language access and protection from deportation.
    - Indigenous women and girls, with tribal sovereignty and culturally grounded healing programs.

#### c. Address Economic Abuse

- Expand access to emergency financial assistance, job training, and economic empowerment programs for survivors.
- Mandate paid safe leave for survivors of GBV at the federal and state levels.

### 4. Data, Research, and Accountability

#### a. Comprehensive Data Collection

- Mandate the CDC, DOJ, and HHS to collect and publicly report intersectional data on all forms of GBV, disaggregated by gender identity, race, ethnicity, disability, and immigration status.
- Fund research on emerging forms of GBV, including TF-GBV and violence against nonbinary and intersex individuals.

#### b. Accountability Mechanisms

- Establish independent oversight bodies at federal and state levels to monitor compliance with anti-GBV laws and investigate systemic failures.
- Require annual public reporting by all federal agencies and grantees on GBV prevention and response efforts.

### 5. Technology and Innovation

#### a. Combat Technology-Facilitated GBV

- Pass federal legislation holding tech companies accountable for preventing, detecting, and responding to online abuse, including mandatory reporting, content moderation, and survivor support.
- Fund research and development of tools to detect and prevent TF-GBV, including AI-driven solutions and privacy-enhancing technologies ([ALIGN, 2024](https://www.alignplatform.org/political-parties-responses-technology-facilitated-gbv)).

#### b. Support Global Innovation

- Expand U.S. funding for global innovation programs addressing GBV in conflict-affected and refugee populations, following best practices from the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) ([FederalGrants.com, 2024](https://www.federalgrants.com/FY-2025-PRM-Request-for-Concept-Notes-for-Global-Innovation-Programs-to-Address-Gender-based-Violence-for-Conflict-Affected-People-102999.html)).

### 6. Education, Prevention, and Cultural Change

#### a. Comprehensive Sex Education

- Mandate age-appropriate, evidence-based sex education in all public schools, covering consent, healthy relationships, and respect for gender diversity.
- Fund public awareness campaigns to challenge harmful gender norms and promote bystander intervention.

#### b. Engage Men and Boys

- Support programs that engage men and boys as allies in preventing GBV, challenging toxic masculinity, and promoting gender equity.

#### c. Political Participation and Leadership

- Require political parties to adopt codes of conduct addressing TF-GBV and harassment.
- Fund training and support for women, LGBTQ+, and BIPOC candidates to increase representation and resilience against violence in public life.

## The Trump Administration, the Supreme Court, and the Fight for Equality

### Trump’s Executive Orders and Their Impact

The Trump administration’s 2025 executive orders represent a direct assault on the civil rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people, and by extension, all survivors of GBV who do not conform to binary gender norms. These actions:

- Institutionalize discrimination by weaponizing federal law and funding.
- Create legal uncertainty for employers, grantees, and service providers ([Holland & Knight, 2025](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/03/the-gender-agenda-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity)).
- Exacerbate vulnerabilities among already marginalized groups, increasing their risk of violence and barriers to justice ([European Business Review, 2025](https://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/two-sexes-trump-executive-order-from-gender-dysphoria-controversy-to-gender-stigma/)).

### The Supreme Court and Federal Civil Rights

The Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in *Bostock v. Clayton County* affirmed that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. However, the Trump administration’s actions have sought to undermine the practical application of this precedent, creating confusion and inviting legal challenges ([Holland & Knight, 2025](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/03/the-gender-agenda-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity)). Lower courts have begun to push back, but the lack of clear federal guidance has left millions vulnerable.

### Our Commitment

We categorically reject the Trump administration’s regressive policies and pledge to:

- Restore and expand federal civil rights protections for all, regardless of gender identity or expression.
- Appoint federal judges and justices committed to upholding equality and human rights.
- Use all legislative, regulatory, and executive tools to defend and advance the rights of survivors and marginalized communities.

## Comparative Analysis: State-Level Legal Changes

| State         | Recent Progressive Reforms                          | Recent Regressive Actions                             |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| California    | Expanded gender marker options; robust survivor funding; inclusive GBV definitions | -                                                     |
| New York      | Comprehensive shelter access for LGBTQ+ survivors; paid safe leave | -                                                     |
| Texas         | Banned gender-affirming care for minors; restricted trans sports participation | -                                                     |
| Florida       | Criminalized provision of gender-affirming care; restricted school discussions of gender | -                                                     |
| Washington    | Statewide TF-GBV law; mandatory consent education in schools | -                                                     |

*Note: This table is illustrative and not exhaustive. The divergence in state laws underscores the urgent need for federal leadership and preemption where basic rights are at risk.*

## Conclusion

Gender-based violence and abuse are not inevitable; they are the result of policy choices, cultural norms, and power imbalances that can and must be changed. Our party is committed to a bold, intersectional, and evidence-based agenda to end GBV in all its forms. We will fight to restore and expand civil rights protections, invest in survivor-centered services, hold perpetrators and institutions accountable, and foster a culture of equality and respect. The stakes are too high for half-measures or retreat. When elected, we will lead with courage, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to justice for all.
