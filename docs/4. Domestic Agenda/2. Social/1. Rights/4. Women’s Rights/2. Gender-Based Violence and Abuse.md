# Policy Platform: Ending Gender-Based Violence and Abuse  
*For a Just, Safe, and Equitable Society*  
**Date:** April 29, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Gender-based violence (GBV) and abuse remain pervasive, deeply rooted issues in the United States and globally. Despite decades of advocacy, legislative progress, and social awareness, millions continue to suffer from physical, sexual, psychological, and technology-facilitated violence, with disproportionate impacts on women, girls, LGBTQI+ individuals, and marginalized communities. As a left-leaning political party committed to equality, justice, and human rights, we present a comprehensive policy platform to eradicate gender-based violence and abuse at both federal and state levels.

This platform is grounded in evidence, recent legislative developments, and the urgent need to counteract regressive trends in federal courts and under potential future administrations. We propose bold, actionable solutions—rooted in survivor-centered, intersectional, and trauma-informed approaches—to prevent violence, protect and empower survivors, hold perpetrators accountable, and transform the systems that perpetuate inequality.

## 1. The Scope and Impact of Gender-Based Violence

### 1.1. Prevalence and Forms

- **Physical and Sexual Violence:** 1 in 3 women globally experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. In the U.S., over 43 million women and 38 million men have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) in their lifetimes ([White House, 2025](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-advanced-gender-equity-and-equality-at-home-and-abroad/)).
- **Technology-Facilitated Abuse:** Up to 85% of women and girls witness technology-facilitated violence, and 20% of women globally report offline attacks linked to online abuse ([The Regulatory Review, 2025](https://www.theregreview.org/2025/01/18/seminar-international-solutions-to-technology-facilitated-gender-based-violence/)).
- **Economic, Emotional, and Psychological Abuse:** Financial manipulation, coercive control, and emotional abuse are recognized as critical forms of GBV, often overlooked by traditional legal frameworks ([LawFuel, 2025](https://www.lawfuel.com/californias-domestic-violence-laws-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)).

### 1.2. Disproportionate Impact

- **Marginalized Communities:** Women of color, LGBTQI+ individuals, Indigenous women, immigrants, and people with disabilities face higher rates of violence and greater barriers to justice and support ([White House, 2025](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-advanced-gender-equity-and-equality-at-home-and-abroad/)).
- **Youth and Online Spaces:** Young women, female politicians, journalists, and activists are especially vulnerable to online harassment and abuse ([The Regulatory Review, 2025](https://www.theregreview.org/2025/01/18/seminar-international-solutions-to-technology-facilitated-gender-based-violence/)).

## 2. Current Challenges and Gaps

### 2.1. Legal and Policy Barriers

| Challenge                                   | Description                                                                                              | Example/Source                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Statute of Limitations                      | Short reporting windows prevent many survivors from seeking justice.                                      | CA SB 273 extended from 1 to 5 years ([LegalClarity, 2024](https://legalclarity.org/overview-of-californias-sb-273-on-domestic-violence-law/)) |
| Inconsistent Definitions and Protections    | Varying state laws and lack of federal standards create confusion and gaps.                               | CA recognizes financial and psychological abuse ([LawFuel, 2025](https://www.lawfuel.com/californias-domestic-violence-laws-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)) |
| Technology-Facilitated Violence             | Laws lag behind new forms of digital abuse, such as doxing and deepfakes.                                 | No comprehensive federal law; international frameworks are “soft law” ([The Regulatory Review, 2025](https://www.theregreview.org/2025/01/18/seminar-international-solutions-to-technology-facilitated-gender-based-violence/)) |
| Supreme Court Decisions                     | Recent rulings have weakened protections and remedies for survivors.                                      | United States v. Morrison, Counterman v. Colorado ([Ms. Magazine, 2023](https://msmagazine.com/2023/09/25/supreme-court-gender-violence-women-counterman-rahimi/)) |

### 2.2. Systemic Failures

- **Law Enforcement Response:** Inadequate training, implicit bias, and lack of trauma-informed practices hinder effective interventions ([LegalClarity, 2024](https://legalclarity.org/overview-of-californias-sb-273-on-domestic-violence-law/)).
- **Resource Gaps:** Funding for survivor services is inconsistent and often insufficient, especially in rural and underserved areas ([Governor of California, 2024](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/12/31/new-in-2025-supporting-more-survivors-strengthening-safety/)).
- **Judicial Barriers:** Survivors face skepticism, victim-blaming, and procedural hurdles in courts.

## 3. Recent Legislative Progress and State Innovations

### 3.1. California: A Model for Reform

California has enacted a suite of new laws in 2025 that exemplify best practices:

| Law         | Key Provisions                                                                 | Impact                                                                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SB 273      | Extends statute of limitations for domestic violence from 1 to 5 years; mandates trauma-informed law enforcement training | More time for survivors to seek justice; improved police response ([LegalClarity, 2024](https://legalclarity.org/overview-of-californias-sb-273-on-domestic-violence-law/)) |
| AB 2432     | Creates California Crime Victims Fund, funded by fines from white-collar crimes | More consistent resources for survivors ([Governor of California, 2024](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/12/31/new-in-2025-supporting-more-survivors-strengthening-safety/)) |
| SB 554      | Allows survivors to file for protection wherever they feel safest              | Increases accessibility of protective orders                                                |
| AB 2308     | Extends domestic violence protective orders up to 15 years                    | Long-term safety for survivors                                                              |
| SB 989      | Enhances law enforcement investigation of domestic violence-related deaths     | Better accountability and closure for families                                              |

### 3.2. Federal Action: Biden-Harris Administration

- **VAWA Reauthorization (2022):** Expanded grant programs, trauma-informed training, and new tools to address technology-facilitated violence ([White House, 2025](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-advanced-gender-equity-and-equality-at-home-and-abroad/)).

## 4. The Threat of Regression: Trump, the Supreme Court, and Federal Rollbacks

### 4.1. Supreme Court Decisions Undermining Protections

- **United States v. Morrison (2000):** Struck down the federal civil remedy for gender-based violence, arguing that crime is a state matter, not federal ([Ms. Magazine, 2021](https://msmagazine.com/2021/10/21/equal-rights-amendment-supreme-court-sexual-assault-era-violence-against-women-vawa-united-states-v-morrison-christy-brzonkala/)).
- **Castle Rock v. Gonzales (2005):** Held that police are not required to enforce restraining orders, even when state law says otherwise.
- **Counterman v. Colorado (2023):** Weakened stalking protections by raising the bar for what constitutes a prosecutable threat ([Ms. Magazine, 2023](https://msmagazine.com/2023/09/25/supreme-court-gender-violence-women-counterman-rahimi/)).
- **Upcoming Cases:** The Court is poised to further weaken gun restrictions for domestic abusers and other critical protections.

### 4.2. Trump Administration and Future Risks

- **First Term:** Rolled back Title IX protections, restricted access to reproductive healthcare, and appointed judges hostile to gender equality ([Human Rights Watch, 2024](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/11/18/interview-womens-rights-under-trump)).
- **Second Term Risks:** Potential for further federal rollbacks, undermining of VAWA, and erosion of judicial and administrative safeguards for survivors.
- **Congressional Inaction:** With Republican control, legislative progress is at risk of stalling or reversing ([Human Rights Watch, 2024](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/11/18/interview-womens-rights-under-trump)).
