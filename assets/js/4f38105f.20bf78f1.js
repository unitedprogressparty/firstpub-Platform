When\nindividuals specialize, productivity surges, lifting societies from\nsubsistence to abundance. Technological innovations and reinvestments in\nproduction further amplify this growth, creating an engine that\ntransforms entire nations. Yet, the very mechanisms that generate wealth\nalso sow the seeds of inequality.

At the same time, labor\nremains largely immobile, subject to wage suppression as companies chase\ncheaper markets. Economic crises, from speculative bubbles to financial\ncollapses like the 2008 debacle, have exposed the vulnerability of\nrelying solely on market self-correction.

Robust measures---targeting\ncapital gains, inheritance, and offshore wealth---are vital to ensuring\nthat the rewards of progress are reinvested into public goods such as\nhealthcare, education, and sustainable infrastructure. Moreover, in an\nera of globalization, domestic reforms must be supplemented by\ncoordinated international treaties that enforce a minimum corporate tax\nand curb the pernicious practices of tax evasion.
