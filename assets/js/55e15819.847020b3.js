Practically, \xe2\u20ac\u0153gathering the empire\xe2\u20ac\x9d means Russia forging bilateral and multilateral deals: e.g., drawing Germany into a partnership (perhaps exchanging Russian political support for German dominance in Western Europe), persuading Japan to ally with Russia (possibly by offering economic concessions or parts of Siberia or the Kuril Islands, as he indeed suggests giving Japan the Kuril Islands back to win its friendship (",(0,a.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Tibet%20%E2%80%93%20381%E2%80%93Inner%20Mongolia%20%E2%80%93,9",children:"Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia"}),") (",(0,a.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Indochina%20%20,9",children:"Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia"}),")).

Dugin also points to practical leverage: Russia\xe2\u20ac\u2122s oil and gas could be used to bind Germany and Europe to it, weakening Atlantic ties. In the East, \xe2\u20ac\u0153gathering the empire\xe2\u20ac\x9d involves integrating Central Asia completely.

Dugin astonishingly argues that Russia and certain Islamic countries share an interest in overturning Western dominance.

In this chapter, he likely describes preliminary steps already taken or possible: Russian support for Iran\xe2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear program or arms, in exchange for Iran\xe2\u20ac\u2122s cooperation against American influence in the Middle East and Central Asia. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Gathering the Empire\xe2\u20ac\x9d thus is about aligning all these pieces: reabsorb former USSR lands, lock in alliances with major Eurasian powers (Germany, Iran, possibly Japan/India), and set the stage to confront the common enemy.

He also emphasizes the need for a strong Russian presence in the Mediterranean: likely via alliances with Greece and a foothold in Syria or other Middle Eastern ports (indeed, Syria\xe2\u20ac\u2122s port Tartus was a minor Russian naval facility in the 90s, and Dugin would have seen potential there). For the Indian Ocean \xe2\u20ac\u0153warm seas,\xe2\u20ac\x9d he envisions access via Iran: if a Moscow-Tehran axis is formed, Iran\xe2\u20ac\u2122s coastline could become available for Russian use, creating a ",(0,a.jsx)(i.em,{children:"\xe2\u20ac\u0153Russian-Iranian strategic continuum\xe2\u20ac\x9d"})," from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf (",(0,a.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20Moscow,38%20promised%20to%20uphold%20the",children:"Putin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Foundations of Geopolitics"}),") (",(0,a.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20anti,These%20can",children:"Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia"}),"). In the Far East, Dugin weighs Russia\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Pacific access: Vladivostok gives a cold Pacific port; he also floats the idea of offering Japan the Kuril Islands in exchange for a break with the US, which could give Russia a partial say in the Western Pacific as an ally of Japan (",(0,a.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#:~:text=Tibet%20%E2%80%93%20381%E2%80%93Inner%20Mongolia%20%E2%80%93,9",children:"Foundations of Geopolitics - Wikipedia"}),").

He likely urges militarization and development of Russia\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Arctic coast (a vision we see Russia follow in the 2000s by building bases in the far north). The chapter underscores that control of key \xe2\u20ac\u0153chokepoints\xe2\u20ac\x9d and maritime routes is as important for Eurasia as it has been for the Atlantic powers. Dugin wants Russia to overcome its traditional naval inferiority: one assumption is that alliances can substitute for a lack of native warm-water ports (e.g., use Iranian or Indian ports through partnership).

The overarching claim is that the U.S. is the ultimate obstacle to a multipolar world, so it must be crippled from within, as direct conquest is impossible. Supporting evidence Dugin might gesture to is America\xe2\u20ac\u2122s own internal strains (racial riots in its history, regional secessionist fringe movements like in Quebec or Texas, etc.) and the success of Soviet active measures in sowing discord during the Cold War. He essentially advises ramping those up. Dugin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s assumptions here are quite bold: he assumes the U.S. societal fabric is weak enough to rend and that doing so would not backfire on Russia. He also counts on America\xe2\u20ac\u2122s geographic insulation to be a weakness \xe2\u20ac\u201c that it can only be reached through subterfuge, not tanks.

The desired outcome in Dugin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s mind would be a U.S. distracted by internal crises (say, racial unrest or political paralysis), unwilling or unable to stop Russia\xe2\u20ac\u2122s consolidation of Eurasia or to intervene decisively overseas (similar to how domestic turmoil in the 1970s post-Vietnam curbed U.S. foreign interventions for a time). In the very long term, he even muses about a potential fragmenting of the U.S. \xe2\u20ac\u201c though not explicitly stated in the summary, some Duginists imagine scenarios like an independent Texas or California.

By calling it a \xe2\u20ac\u0153New Geopolitical Order,\xe2\u20ac\x9d he suggests a permanent solution: perhaps reshuffling borders or creating new autonomies that align with ethnic realities (for example, he might foresee that if Georgia stays anti-Russian, Russia could recognize breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia \xe2\u20ac\u201c which in fact happened in 2008, reflecting this logic). So domestically, Russia preemptively treats South Ossetians and Abkhaz as quasi-citizens (handing out passports, etc., which they did).

He also takes Spykman\xe2\u20ac\u2122s insight that sea powers will use peripheral allies and applies it: thus, Dugin endeavors to strip those allies away (like Turkey, Japan, Western Europe\xe2\u20ac\u2122s coastal states) from the U.S. The logical structure of Dugin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s thinking \xe2\u20ac\u201c break NATO, cause U.S. alliances to crumble \xe2\u20ac\u201c is derived from understanding Spykman\xe2\u20ac\u2122s containment. Another adaptation is how Dugin frames conflicts like Ukraine or Georgia: during the Cold War these were part of the internal Soviet space, but after 1991 they became part of a new Rimland separating Russia from NATO. Dugin often describes these countries as pawns of Atlantic containment (his term \xe2\u20ac\u0153sanitary cordon\xe2\u20ac\x9d is directly borrowed from French strategists and Spykman\xe2\u20ac\u2122s concept (",(0,a.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%205%20347%20Threat%20of,351"}),") (",(0,a.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://www.maieutiek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Foundations-of-Geopolitics.pdf#:~:text=5,351"}),")). So he draws on Spykman to identify the weak links to target (Baltics, Balkans, Caucasus, etc.). In effect, Dugin uses Spykman\xe2\u20ac\u2122s map in reverse \xe2\u20ac\u201c whereas Western strategists sought to maintain a ring of pro-West states around Russia, Dugin seeks to shatter that ring. This is how he justifies, for example, Russian support for separatists in the Baltics or Balkans: it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a necessary offense to destroy the containment architecture. Thus, Spykman\xe2\u20ac\u2122s theory is not rejected by Dugin; it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s acknowledged as true but detrimental to Russia, so he develops an anti-Rimland doctrine: essentially a plan for ",(0,a.jsx)(i.em,{children:"\xe2\u20ac\u0153offensive de-containment.\xe2\u20ac\x9d"})]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(i.li,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsxs)(i.p,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"Karl Haushofer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Eurasian Pan-Regions:"})," Haushofer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s concept of Geopolitik in the 1930s envisaged the world divided into large \xe2\u20ac\u0153pan-regions\xe2\u20ac\x9d dominated by great powers (he saw a German-led European bloc, a Russian-led Eurasian bloc, a Japanese-led East Asia, etc., potentially allied).

Haushofer also emphasized the strategic importance of ",(0,a.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"Central Asia"})," and a German-Russian link to counter Britain. Dugin fully agrees: his stress on Central Asia being Russia\xe2\u20ac\u2122s backyard and the notion of a Berlin-Moscow axis are straight from Haushofer. One difference: Haushofer believed strongly in German-Japanese cooperation; Dugin, writing when Japan was tied to the US, hedges by considering India as an alternate or additional Asian partner (",(0,a.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/5/28/putins-playbook-reviewing-dugins-foundations-of-geopolitics#:~:text=In%20the%20Moscow,prime%20choice%20for%20an%20ally",children:"Putin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Playbook: #Reviewing Dugin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Foundations of Geopolitics"}),").

Dugin also shares Haushofer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s acceptance of temporarily allying with ideologically different regimes for geopolitical gain (Haushofer, a German, was willing to work with Soviet Russia or court India against the Anglo powers; Dugin likewise is happy to ally with Iran or China short-term despite differing ideology). Another adaptation is Dugin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s integration of ",(0,a.jsx)(i.em,{children:"race and culture"}),": Haushofer, being in Nazi milieu, did reference racial aspects (Aryan connection between Germans and some Asians).

He is more focused on cultural ideology (traditional societies vs Atlantic liberal) than pure race. Still, the influence is clear: Dugin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Eurasianism is in many respects a successor to Haushofer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s vision of a Euro-Asiatic block.
