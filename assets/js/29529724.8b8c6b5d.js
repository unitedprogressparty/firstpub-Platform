The inclusion of RFK and MLK records (which were not covered by the JFK Records Act and have not been a major public demand) hints that the motive is to fuel a narrative of \xe2\u20ac\u0153deep state\xe2\u20ac\x9d wrongdoing in the 1960s. Many far-right conspiracy theorists (and some on the left) believe the CIA or FBI were involved in these assassinations; Trump himself has feuded with the intelligence community. By forcing out all records quickly, the EO could be aiming to ",(0,s.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"validate suspicions or embarrass those agencies"}),", rather than genuinely enlighten history. The real effect could be a ",(0,s.jsx)(i.em,{children:"flood of raw, uncontextualized documents"})," that revives controversies. Some documents might be misinterpreted, feeding new conspiracy theories rather than settling them. Also, hurried declassification might inadvertently reveal names of informants or innocuous secrets, causing collateral damage (though the EO says it will be done \xe2\u20ac\u0153consistent with applicable law,\xe2\u20ac\x9d presumably still allowing redactions for current security).

Furthermore, the selection of these particular records (all involving iconic figures, two of whom \xe2\u20ac\u201c JFK and RFK \xe2\u20ac\u201c were Democratic leaders, and MLK a civil rights leader) could be interpreted as an attempt to rewrite narratives or ",(0,s.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"shift blame for these murders onto supposed government plots"}),", which stokes distrust in institutions.

By suggesting that past administrations hid \xe2\u20ac\u0153the truth\xe2\u20ac\x9d about these high-profile killings, Trump casts himself as the outsider finally exposing corruption, even if from 50 years ago. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s notable that he issued this just a few days into his second term, indicating it was a priority perhaps for its theater. It complements other second-term actions like \xe2\u20ac\u0153restoring historical honor\xe2\u20ac\x9d (for example, earlier on Jan 20 he ordered \xe2\u20ac\u0153Restoring Biological Truth\xe2\u20ac\x9d in government \xe2\u20ac\u201c a very different arena, but similarly framed as revealing truth). The EO allowed Trump to posture as uniquely transparent compared to previous presidents (even though, ironically, he resisted release of some JFK files in 2017). In a sense, it diverts attention: rather than talk about current controversies (his own administration\xe2\u20ac\u2122s actions), people are talking about JFK and MLK again. This can inflame partisan talk as well \xe2\u20ac\u201c for instance, if MLK files reveal more about FBI harassment, Trump can use that to bash FBI integrity (useful as he fights his own federal investigations perhaps).

If conspiracies arise from misinterpretation, officials (and reputable historians) need to swiftly correct the record to prevent misinformation from taking root.
