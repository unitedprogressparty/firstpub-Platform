Diplomats were instructed to prioritize negotiating better trade terms and defense cost-sharing. Allies noticed the shift: for example, NATO partners were faced with even firmer demands to increase military spending or host U.S. bases on Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s terms, straining relations.

The State Department historically has a \xe2\u20ac\u0153Dissent Channel\xe2\u20ac\x9d allowing diplomats to privately express disagreement with policy; under Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s new regime, using that channel was widely seen as career suicide.

In summary, the EO turned the State Department into much more of a ",(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"top-down, White House-centric operation"}),", with policy statements and actions rigidly reflecting Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s nationalist ideology at the expense of expert input and international goodwill."]}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(i.li,{children:[(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"Fit with Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Broader Goals:"})," This directive is the foreign policy counterpart to Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s domestic centralization of power.

Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s broader goal of projecting strength through unpredictability also plays in: by silencing the nuanced diplomacy, he aimed to make U.S. stances blunt and, in his view, more intimidating (he often complained U.S. negotiators were \xe2\u20ac\u0153weak\xe2\u20ac\x9d or too conciliatory). This EO also aligns with Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s personal style of governance: loyalty and personal control above all. Just as he demanded domestic agencies follow his lead without question, here he demands the U.S. diplomatic corps become messengers of his worldview, not independent analysts. It fulfills promises to his base to stop \xe2\u20ac\u0153apologizing\xe2\u20ac\x9d for America or subordinating U.S. interests to global causes.

This fits Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s goal of renegotiating relationships: allies must do more for the U.S. or face U.S. retrenchment; adversaries are approached with blunt demands (e.g., trade concessions from China) rather than coalition pressure. Additionally, by reforming the Foreign Service, Trump advances his long-term ideological project of removing the so-called \xe2\u20ac\u0153globalists\xe2\u20ac\x9d or \xe2\u20ac\u0153deep state\xe2\u20ac\x9d from the halls of diplomacy.

Seasoned diplomats describe a chilling atmosphere where they could not frankly advise Washington for fear of being seen as \xe2\u20ac\u0153off message,\xe2\u20ac\x9d leading to missed opportunities and blunders. For instance, intelligence warnings or diplomatic cables that contradicted Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s rosy views of certain authoritarian leaders might have been downplayed \xe2\u20ac\u201c possibly skewing policy decisions regarding Russia or North Korea.

Internally, the reorientation and talk of purges led to an exodus of experienced career staff (a phenomenon also seen in Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s first term). Losing institutional knowledge makes it harder for the U.S. to execute complex negotiations (trade deals, arms control, etc.), because relationships and expertise were damaged. For example, if the lead diplomat on an international climate financing negotiation is suddenly reassigned for pushing too hard on a \xe2\u20ac\u0153globalist\xe2\u20ac\x9d initiative, the U.S. might lose leverage or credibility in that negotiation.

On the ground, some immediate effects were: cuts to foreign aid programs \xe2\u20ac\u201c including those providing healthcare, food, and climate resilience in poorer countries \xe2\u20ac\u201c leading to suffering in regions that had relied on U.S. support.

Diplomatic crises also became harder to manage multilaterally. Career U.S. diplomats were no longer encouraged to take initiative in international forums, so in conflicts like an outbreak of violence in the Middle East or Africa, the U.S. voice might have been muted or solely accusatory rather than collaborative.

Agencies like the Department of Education likely halted initiatives on racial disparities in school discipline, since \xe2\u20ac\u0153equity\xe2\u20ac\x9d was now a dirty word.

Agencies ended partnerships with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) or minority professional associations if those were seen as giving preference in hiring \xe2\u20ac\u201c even though these efforts merely expanded the pool of candidates. Performance evaluations and promotion criteria were rewritten overnight to excise any mention of contributing to an inclusive workplace. Some employees even removed pronouns or affinity group memberships from their email signatures, fearing that could be labeled as DEI activity. The EO also led to the ",(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"closure of offices like Environmental Justice units"})," at EPA or HUD \xe2\u20ac\u201c units that addressed how pollution and housing issues disproportionately affect minority communities were now considered part of the \xe2\u20ac\u0153radical\xe2\u20ac\x9d agenda and defunded.

In reality, this doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t make disparities go away \xe2\u20ac\u201c it just forbids people from talking about or addressing them. The EO thus likely worsened workplace climate for many federal employees from marginalized groups. Without DEI training or offices, incidents of harassment or bias had fewer avenues for resolution. Some employees saw it as open season to disparage \xe2\u20ac\u0153woke\xe2\u20ac\x9d concepts, further marginalizing colleagues.

The EO\xe2\u20ac\u2122s severability clause (",(0,r.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/#:~:text=Sec,circumstances%20shall%20not%20be%20affected",children:"Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing \xe2\u20ac\u201c The White House"}),") indicates Trump anticipated parts might fall, but even if half of it survives, the damage to trust and momentum for DEI in government is done. Another subtle harm: government data collection on inequality ceased or was politicized. That means future policymakers might lack the statistics to even know where disparities lie, hampering evidence-based policy for years. Finally, this EO sent a symbolic message that ",(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"diversity is not valued"})," by the U.S. government \xe2\u20ac\u201c a demoralizing signal to millions of Americans.

Rebuilding that trust will be challenging."]}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(i.li,{children:[(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"How a Future Administration Can Undo the Damage:"})," A new administration must ",(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"rescind EO\xc2\xa014151 immediately"})," and any related policies (such as the contracting rules or OPM guidance that enforced it). Next, it should issue a sweeping ",(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"\xe2\u20ac\u0153Restoring DEI and Civil Rights in Government\xe2\u20ac\x9d"})," order. This could reinstate the Obama- and Biden-era framework: require agencies to revive or create Offices of Diversity and Inclusion, and update strategic plans to include equity goals. The Equity Action Plans that agencies developed under Biden\xe2\u20ac\u2122s EO\xc2\xa013985 can be dusted off and updated to current needs, then reimplemented. Importantly, the new order should clarify that lawful DEI programs ",(0,r.jsx)(i.em,{children:"are consistent with merit and civil rights law"}),", to counter the narrative of illegality. The administration\xe2\u20ac\u2122s legal teams will need to review any Trump-era rules or regulations issued to implement EO\xc2\xa014151 (for example, OPM might have altered federal hiring rules, or OMB might have changed grant guidelines). Those can be reversed through expedited processes or even emergency authority if needed (arguing that Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s policies undermine the missions of agencies). To address the contractor/grantee side: new guidance can explicitly reassure federal contractors and grant recipients that ",(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"prior diversity commitments will not jeopardize federal funds"}),". In fact, the administration could encourage those partners to ",(0,r.jsx)(i.em,{children:"continue"})," DEI efforts, perhaps by offering technical assistance or positive incentives (e.g., reinstating something akin to the Obama-era \xe2\u20ac\u0153",(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"Justice Department Smart on Crime"}),"\xe2\u20ac\x9d grant criteria that rewarded equity). Some damage will require legislation or litigation outcomes to fully fix. If courts were involved, the Justice Department under new leadership can move to settle or drop the defense of Trump\xe2\u20ac\u2122s EO in ongoing cases, effectively agreeing that the injunctions against it should stand permanently. This would free agencies from its yoke even faster. On the workforce side, a concerted effort is needed to ",(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"rebuild trust and capacity"}),". That means immediately reopening diversity training programs and endorsing agency affinity groups and special emphasis programs (like those supporting women, veterans, minorities, disabled employees). Offering carrots could help: perhaps a directive that ",(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"SES (Senior Executive Service) personnel should reflect America\xe2\u20ac\u2122s diversity"}),", accompanied by mentorship and recruitment initiatives to advance talented minority employees into leadership (legally, this must be done carefully, but goals can be set and progress measured). The administration should also consider rehiring or elevating officials who were forced out \xe2\u20ac\u201c for example, if a Chief Diversity Officer or civil rights director in an agency was removed, find a way to bring them back or use their expertise, to signal a clean break. In terms of ",(0,r.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"policy outcomes"}),": re-establish all the interagency councils and advisory boards that Trump abolished (the White House Gender Policy Council, initiatives on HBCUs, Hispanic-serving institutions, Asian American initiatives \xe2\u20ac\u201c many were killed by EO\xc2\xa014148 and 14151 (",(0,r.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/#:~:text=,Excellence%2C%20and%20Economic%20Opportunity%20for",children:"Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions \xe2\u20ac\u201c The White House"}),") (",(0,r.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/#:~:text=Hispanics%29.%20,Infrastructure%20Investment%20and%20Jobs%20Act",children:"Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions \xe2\u20ac\u201c The White House"}),"), these should be reactivated via executive order or statute). The President can also appoint strong civil rights advocates to key roles (head of OPM, OMB Office of Federal Procurement Policy, etc.) to drive the pro-DEI agenda through bureaucratic inertia. To guard against a future anti-DEI swing, some measures could be codified into law: for instance, Congress could enact that each federal agency must have an Office of Diversity and Inclusion and an equity plan (making it harder to abolish by EO alone). While getting such legislation might be challenging, even appropriations bills could include language protecting funding for DEI roles. Culturally, the administration should go on offense to explain to the public and Congress that these initiatives ",(0,r.jsx)(i.em,{children:"enhance"})," merit and performance by drawing on the talents of all Americans and correcting for bias. Real-life examples (like improved service delivery due to diverse teams, or success stories from internship programs for disadvantaged youth that feed into federal jobs) can be highlighted to build support.
