The assurance of a consistent, unconditional income eliminates fear-driven decisions, enables personal and professional development, and prepares us for the shifting landscape of work in a rapidly evolving economy. This proposal reaffirms our commitment to collective well-being, individual dignity, and true economic freedom for every citizen."})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,o.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}}}]);
