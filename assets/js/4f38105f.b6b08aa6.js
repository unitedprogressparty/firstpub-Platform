However, in practice, globalization has morphed\r\ninto a sophisticated tool for the evasion of accountability.\r\nMultinational corporations increasingly exploit international borders to\r\nshift profits into tax havens, thus evading the responsibilities that\r\ncome with contributing to public welfare. At the same time, labor\r\nremains largely immobile, subject to wage suppression as companies chase\r\ncheaper markets.
