Although markets may appear to\r\nfunction under equal agreements, the concentration of productive power\r\nand profit in the hands of a few creates a systemic imbalance that\r\ndisadvantages most workers.

A\r\nfraction of this input is compensated through wages, while a\r\nconsiderable surplus stays with those who finance or possess the means\r\nof production. Over the long run, these accumulated earnings drive\r\nexpansions, spark new technologies, and intensify the race to undercut\r\ncompetitors.
